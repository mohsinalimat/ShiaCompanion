He has also cited the big rewards of saying and offering these supplications and prayers. For instance, it is recommended to offer a one hundred unit prayer with Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Tawheed three times. After accomplishment, the doxological statements are repeated seventy times:\nسُبْحَانَ اللهِ\nSUBHAANAL LAAHE\nAll glory be to Allah,\nوَالْحَمْدُ لِلهِ\nWAL HAMDO LILLAAHE\nall praise be to Allah,\nوَلَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ\nWA LAA ELAAHA ILLAL LAAHO WAL LAAHO \nthere is no god save Allah,\nوَاللهُ اَكْبَرُ\nWAL LAAHO AKBARO\nAllah is the Greatest,\nوَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيمِ\nWA LAA HAWLA WA LAA QUWWATA ILLAA BILLAAHIL A'LIYYIL A'ZEEM\nand there is neither might nor power save with Allah, the All-high the All-great.\n\nAccording to another narration, one should implore for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness after the previously mentioned statements.\nIt is also recommended to offer a four unit prayer at the last of this night, reciting Surah al-Faatehah once and repeating Ayah al-Kursi and Surahs al-Tawheed, al-Falaq, al-Nas ten times each. After accomplishment, Surah al-Tawheed is repeated one hundred times.\nIt is also recommended to offer a four unit prayer with Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Tawheed fifty times. Matching the prayer of Imam Ali Ameer al-Momineen (a.s.), which brings about a tremendous reward, Sayyid Ibn Tawus says after citing this prayer, “When you finish the fourth units, you may mention Almighty Allah, invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household, and curse their enemies as many times as possible.\nAs regarding the reward of spending this whole night with acts of worship, it has been narrated that one who does so shall be considered having worshipped Almighty Allah with the worship of all the angels. Furthermore, to practice acts of worship at this night is equal to seventy-year worship. Moreover, as for one who succeeds to visit the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) at this night and spends the whole night there up to morning, Almighty Allah shall resurrect him, on the Judgment Day, spotted with the blood of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) in the group of those who were martyred with him.",
