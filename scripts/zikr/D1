After completing the obligatory prayer (wajib salaat) – instead of being immediately wrapped up in worldly affairs, games or pastime, to stay in the presence of the Almighty Lord under the umbrella of His grace to call, invoke or request Him through supplication is ta’qeeb.\nAccording to a most reliable tradition every ta’qeeb is dua’:\nThe Almighty Lord says in the Holy Quran:\nAnd when My servants ask you about Me, then (say to them that) verily I am very near - I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he beseeches Me. (Al Baqarah (2), Verse 186.)\nAccording to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) the essence of Salaat is dua’.\nThere are several rewards Allah promises to bestow on those who recite ta’qeebaat. For example those who recite tasbeeh of Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (s.a.) after every salaat receives recompense of a thousand rak’at and other countless blessings.\nIn fact it is the decoration (zeenat) of Salaat.\nVerses 190 and 191 of Aal-e-Imran say that:\n“Men of understanding remember (pray to) Allah standing, sitting and reclining.”\nVerse 62 of Naml says:\n“Allah answers the distressed when he calls (prays) to Him, and removes the distress.”\nVerse 186 of Surah Baqarah says:\n“I (Allah) answer the prayer of the supplicant when he cries unto Me.”\n So recite taqeebat after wajib prayers to seek pleasure of Allah and to beseech Him for His favours and bounties.",
