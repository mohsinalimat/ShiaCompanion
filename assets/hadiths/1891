Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Whoever performs the ablution correctly and thereafter prays two units of prayer, completes its genuflexions and prostrations, sends the salutations [at the end of the prayer], praises Allah and the Prophet (SAWA), then asks his need in the right place will not be disappointed, because whoever seeks good from the right place is never disappointed.’
