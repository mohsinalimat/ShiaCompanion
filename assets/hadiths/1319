The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘I have been given five things that no prophet before me was given: I was sent to the white, black and red; the earth has been made pure for me and a place for prostration; I have been made victorious with awe; and spoils were permitted for me when they were not permitted to any before me [or to any prophet before me]; and I have been given mastery over words.’
