The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'There are two virtues unexcelled by anything better: faith in Allah, and being of benefit to Allah's servants. And there are two iniquities unsurpassed by anything worse: associating something with Allah, and causing harm to Allah's servants.â€™
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 137, no. 2]
