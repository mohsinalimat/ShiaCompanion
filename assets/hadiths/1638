Imam al-Baqir and Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Only that part of your prayer in which you engaged with your full attention is accepted. So if one is inattentive in all of it or careless in his performance of it, that same prayer is crumpled up and thrown back at his face.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 84, p. 260, no. 59]
