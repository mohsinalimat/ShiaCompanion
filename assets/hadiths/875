Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘A plant grows on level ground and not on the hard terrain, and similarly wisdom flourishes in the heart of the humble, and does not flourish in the heart of the haughty and overbearing, because Allah made humbleness the instrument of the intellect and haughtiness the instrument of ignorance.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 312, no. 1]
