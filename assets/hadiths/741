The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Pay more attention to performing deeds with Godwariness than deeds without it, for action with Godwariness is never considered little, and how can an accepted action be little for Allah has said, ‘"Allah accepts only from the Godwary."[ Qur’an 5:27] [Bihar al-Anwar, v. 70, p. 286, no. 8]
