Imam al-Rida (AS) said, 'The archangel Gabriel descended to the Prophet (SAWA) and told him, 'O Muhammad, verily your Lord extends salutations on you and says, 'Verily the virgins from among your women are as fruits on a tree, which when they ripen must be plucked otherwise the sun rots them and the wind alters them. So when young women reach marriageable age, they have no other recourse apart from husbands, otherwise they will not be safe from corruption.’ The Prophet (SAWA) then climbed the pulpit, gathered the people and informed them of what Allah had commanded him.’
