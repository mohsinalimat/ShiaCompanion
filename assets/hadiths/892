Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) said to me, ‘With respect to my people, I am afraid neither of a believer nor of an unbeliever. As for the believer, Allah will afford him protection because of his belief and as for the disbeliever, Allah will humiliate him because of his disbelief. But I am afraid about every one from among you who is a hypocrite in his heart and eloquent of speech. He speaks what you hold to be good but does what you dislike.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 68]
