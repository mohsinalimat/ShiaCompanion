Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘…until Allah sent Muhammad (SAWA) as a witness, a warner and a bringer of glad tidings. He was the best of people as a child, and the most noble of them when old. He was the purest of the pure in character and the most generous of all givers of all time.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 108]
