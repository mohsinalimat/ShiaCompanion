Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘He who [undertakes to] describe Him has defined Him, and he who defines Him has numbered Him, and he who numbers Him has nullified His eternity. He who asks ‘How?’ [about Allah] has indeed sought to describe Him, and he who asks ‘Where?’ has indeed confined Him.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 152]
