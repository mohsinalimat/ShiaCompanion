Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘…But Allah tests His worshippers with many different hardships, He makes them engage in different struggles, and He makes them undergo multiple misfortunes. All this in order to extract arrogance from their hearts, to establish humbleness in their selves, and to make them open the doors to His Grace.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 192]
