The Prophet (SAWA) was once told, ‘We only enjoin that which we ourselves practice absolutely and we only prohibit that which we refrain from absolutely’, to which he replied, ‘No, rather enjoin good even if you yourself do not practice it absolutely and prohibit wrong even if you yourself do not refrain from it absolutely.’
[Tanbih al-Khawatir, v. 2, p. 213]
