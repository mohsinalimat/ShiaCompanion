Imam Husayn (AS) said, ‘When Allah with His Generosity and Benevolence made the obligations a duty upon you, He did not do so for a need He has for them. Rather, it is as a result of the Benevolence He has over you - there is no god but He - and in order to distinguish between the bad and the good, and to test what is in your chests, and to purify what is in your hearts.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 23, p. 99, no. 3]
