The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Four things kill the heart: sin after sin, excessive discussion with women - meaning conversing with them -, disputing with a foolish person, you speak and he speaks and he will never become better, and sitting in the company of the dead.’ At this, he was asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, and who are the dead?’ He said, ‘Every rich and affluent person.’
