Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘I have never left the night prayer since I heard the Prophet (SAWA) say that the night prayer is a light.’ Ibn al-Kawwa’ asked, ‘Not even on the night of al-Harir?’ [al-Harir: a celebrated battle between two tribes (ed.)] to which he replied, ‘Not even on the night of al-Harir.’
