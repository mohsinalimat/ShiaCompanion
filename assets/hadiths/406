Imam Ali (AS) said to his son al-Hasan (AS), ‘O son, increase your remembrance of death, of that which overcomes it, and of that which you will return to after death such that when it comes to you, you will have taken heed of it and strengthened yourself for it, and you will not let it overcome you by surprise so that it bewilders you.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 31]
