Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in his supplication on the day of `Aarafa, 'Let me taste, through some of Your boundless plenty, the flavour of being free for what You love, and striving in what brings about proximity with You and to You, and give me a gift from among Your gifts! Make my commerce profitable and my return without loss, fill me with fear of Your station, and make me yearn for the meeting with You.'[al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, supplication 47]
