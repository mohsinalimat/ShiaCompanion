The archangel Gabriel (AS), when he was asked by the Prophet (SAWA) about the meaning of sincerity, replied, ‘The sincere one is he who does ask the people anything until he himself finds it, and when he finds it he is pleased. Whenever he has a remainder of a thing, he gives it to others, because if a person does not ask anything from creation, he has established that his servitude is solely for Allah, Mighty and Exalted, and if he finds and he is pleased then he is pleased with Allah and Allah - Blessed and most High - is pleased with him, and if he gives for the sake of Allah then he has reached the station of reliance on his Lord, Mighty and Exalted.’
