Imam Ali (AS) said, 'Courage has been created based on three natural characteristics, each of which has an exclusive merit over the rest. They are: self-esteem, dignity [in the face of humiliation], and seeking a good reputation. If they all attain perfection in the courageous man, he is an invincible hero, distinguished for his boldness in his generation. And if some of them are perfected in him more than others, then his courage will far supercede in those particular qualities over the rest.â€™
