Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Prayer is the pillar of religion and its likeness is as the likeness of the pillar of a tent. If the pillar is stably fixed, the pegs and the ropes remain stable, but if the pillar inclines and breaks, neither peg nor rope remains fixed.’
[al-Mahasin, v. 1, p. 116, no. 117]
