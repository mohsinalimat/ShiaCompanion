Imam Ali (AS) said in his counsel to his son ?asan (AS), ‘Know that the one in whose hands are the treasures the kingdom of this world and the Hereafter has allowed you to supplicate, He has guaranteed to answer you, He has commanded you to ask Him so He can give you, and He is the All-Merciful, the Kind. He has not placed any barrier between Him and you, He has not committed you to whoever intercedes for you… then He has placed in your hands the keys to His treasures by allowing you to ask from Him, so whenever you wish, open the doors of His treasures by supplicating to Him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 204, no. 1]
