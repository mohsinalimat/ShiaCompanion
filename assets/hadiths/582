Imam al-Kazim (AS), when asked about the grave sins and whether they expel one from faith?’, replied, ‘Yes.’ [And when asked about other than grave sins], said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘An adulterer would never commit adultery whilst still a believer and a thief would never steal whilst still a believer.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 69, p. 63, no. 7]
