Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, 'Iblis [Satan] said, 'There are five types of people against whom I have no stratagem, whilst I have the rest of people firmly in my grasp: he who clings fast to Allah with a true intention and relies solely on Him in all his affairs, he who is in constant and abundant glorification of Allah day and night, he who pleases for his brother in faith whatever he pleases for himself, he who does not feel anxious about an affliction when it befalls him, and he who is satisfied with whatever Allah has allotted to him and does not worry about his sustenance.â€™
