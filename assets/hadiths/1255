Imam al-Sadiq (AS) narrated that Umm Salama [the Prophet's wife] asked the Prophet (SAWA) about the status of women when being of service to their husbands, so he (SAWA) replied, 'Any woman who so much as moves something from one place to another in her husband's house with the intention of improving it is regarded with mercy by Allah, and whoever Allah regards [with mercy] He does not punish.â€™
