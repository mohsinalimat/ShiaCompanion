Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘And that is the day when Allah will gather all people from the first to the last, standing in subjugation in order to discuss the account [of their deeds] and the recompense for their actions. They will be bridled with their own sweat while the earth trembles under them. Those amongst them in the best state will be those who manage to find a stable place for their feet to stand and an open space for them to breathe!’ [Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 102]
