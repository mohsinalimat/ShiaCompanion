Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘A believer is silent in order to be safe, and speaks in order to benefit…. If he is praised he fears what they say and he repents to Allah for what they do not know. He is not deceived by the sayings of those who do not know him, and he fears being accountable for the things he has done.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 231, no. 3]
