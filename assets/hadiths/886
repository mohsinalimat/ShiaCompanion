Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘A hypocrite, when he looks he is frivolous, when he is silent he forgets, when he speaks he prattles, when he becomes wealthy he tyrannizes, when hardship afflicts him he is treacherous, so he is close to discontentment and far from contentment. Minor things make him discontented with Allah, and he is never content, even with much. He intends to do a lot of evil and commits some of them, and he regrets the evil deeds that pass him by and how he did not manage to commit them.’
[Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, p. 212]
