Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘When the ZaqqUm and the cactus will boil in the stomachs of the people of the Fire, like boiling water, they will ask for a drink, and will be given a drink made of pus and festering matter. One will swallow it painfully but will not enjoy it, and death will come to him from all sides though he will not die.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 8, p. 302, no. 58]
