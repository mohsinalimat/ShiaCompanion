Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘A group of the people of the past said to their prophet, ‘Pray to your Lord to take death away from us. He did so and Allah took death away from them. They became so many that their houses became crowded and their offspring became too many. A man had to feed his father, mother and grandfather, and his great grandfather, and they had to cleanse and take care of them. They became too occupied to seek a livelihood, so they said, ‘Ask your Lord to return us to our previous state. So, their Prophet asked his Lord and He returned them to their original state.’
