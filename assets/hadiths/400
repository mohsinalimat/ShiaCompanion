Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS), when asked about death said, ‘For a believer, it is like taking off dirty clothes, undoing shackles and heavy chains, and changing into the finest and most scented of clothes. It is the happiest of stations and the most comforting of abodes. As for the infidel, it is like taking off fine clothes, transferring from comfortable abodes, and changing into the dirtiest and roughest of clothes, the most terrifying of stations and the greatest of punishments.’
