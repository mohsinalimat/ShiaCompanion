Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Listen O negligent and fickle one to someone who exhorts and expounds. The Day of Resurrection has been made a day of exposition, questioning, bestowal and exemplary punishment. It is the day when men’ s deeds will be upturned, and all sins will be computed, when people’ s pupils will melt with grief and expectant women will deliver what they carry in their wombs.’
[Amali al-Tusi, p. 653, no. 1353]
