The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘He [the hypocrite] will come on the Day of Judgment with two faces and with his tongue hanging out from the back of his head, and with another tongue hanging in front. They will both be ignited with fire until they ignite his body, then it will be said about him: This is the one who was two-faced and two-tongued in the world, and he will be known as such on the Day of Resurrection .’
