Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily when Allah, Blessed and most High, will wish to deal with the believer’s account, He will give him his book in his right hand and will then take him to account for all that is between him and Himself, and will say, ‘My servant, you have committed such and such and have done such and such!’ and he will reply, ‘Yes, my Lord, I have done that.’ And Allah will say, ‘I have forgiven you for them and have transformed them into good deeds’ , so people will ask, ‘Glory be to Allah, did this man not have a single evil deed!’ and this is the purport of Allah’ s verse “Then as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he shall soon receive an easy reckoning, and he will return to his folks joyfully” [Qur’ an 847-9].
