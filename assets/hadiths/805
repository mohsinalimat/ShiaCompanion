The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘A child is a master for seven years, a slave for the next seven years, and a minister for another seven years. By the age of twenty one, you must either approve of his manners or cut him loose, for [by then] you would have fulfilled your obligation toward Allah, most High.’
[Makarim al-Akhlaq, v. 1, p. 478, no. 1649]
