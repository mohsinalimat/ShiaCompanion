Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The truth is the widest thing in description, but the narrowest in practicing justice. No sooner does it side with someone than it will side against him [at another time], and no sooner does it side against someone than it will side for him later. And if anyone is to side with it, never going against it, then that would be purely for Allah, glory be to Him.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 216]
