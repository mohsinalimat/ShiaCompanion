Imam al-Kazim (AS) said to Hashim, exhorting him, ‘You must beware of greed, and despair of acquiring anything in the possession of others. Suppress the greed in others for verily greed is the key to disgrace, it exploits the intellect, fabricates valorous qualities for itself, tarnishes one’s reputation, and does away with one’s knowledge.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 315, no. 1]
