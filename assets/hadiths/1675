Imam al-Baqir (AS) narrated, 'At the end of Sha`aban, when there were only three days left till the month of Ramadhan, the Prophet (SAWA) told Bilal, 'Call all the people', so the people gathered together. The Prophet (SAWA) mounted the pulpit, praised Allah and glorified Him, then continued, 'O people, this month that is coming upon you is the chief of all months. One particular night in it is better than a thousand months. During this month, the gates of Hell are locked up, and the gates of Paradise are opened. So whoever, in spite of experiencing this month is not forgiven, has indeed been distanced by Allah.â€™
