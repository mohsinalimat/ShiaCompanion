The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘The best of people is he who longs for worship and embraces it, loves it with his heart, throws himself into it with his whole body, and devotes himself exclusively to it, such that he is not concerned in what worldly state he wakes up in the morning: in difficulty or in ease.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 83, no. 3]
