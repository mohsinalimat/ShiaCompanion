Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The limits of the greatest obligations that Allah has ordained upon His creation are five: prayer, the alms-tax (zakat), the obligatory pilgrimage (Hajj), fasting, and the guardianship [of those divinely appointed by Allah] (wilaya), which is the protector for the former four.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 68, p. 388, no. 39]
