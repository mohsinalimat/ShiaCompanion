Imam al-Rida (AS), regarding the reason for ablution, said, ‘So that the servant is pure when he stands before the Mighty One when engaged in supplication to Him, being obedient to Him through what He has commanded him, purified of filths and impurities, and also because it does away with laziness and repels drowsiness, and purifies the heart for standing before the Mighty One.’
[`AeIlal al-Shara’i`a, p. 257, no. 9]
