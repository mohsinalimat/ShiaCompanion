Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Verily Godwariness is the remedy for the sickness of your hearts, and the sight for the blindness of your hearts, and the cure for the sickness of your bodies, and the correction of the corruption of your chests, and the purification for the pollution of your selves, and the unveiling of the blurriness of your eyes.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 198]
