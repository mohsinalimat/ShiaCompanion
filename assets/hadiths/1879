Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Verily a servant asks Allah his need and it is Allah’s way that He either grants it very soon or after some time. The servant sins and Allah - Blessed and most High - says to the angels, ‘Do not grant him, and deprive him of it for verily he has exposed himself to My displeasure and has made himself deserving of My deprivation.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 73, p. 329, no. 11]
