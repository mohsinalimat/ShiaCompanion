Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said to one of his companions, ‘Verily we are very patient and our Shi`aa are even more patient than us.’ His companion asked, ‘May I be your ransom, how can your Shi`aa be more patient than yourselves?’ He replied, ‘Because we are patient alongside our knowledge [of everything], whereas our Shi`aa are patient in spite of not knowing.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 93, no. 25]
