The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘A servant’s faith in Allah is not complete until he has five attributes in him: complete reliance upon Allah, entrusting [his affairs] to Allah, submission to Allah’s will, contentment with Allah’s decree, and patience in Allah’s tribulations. Certainly one who loves for the sake of Allah, hates for the sake of Allah, gives for the sake of Allah, and withholds for the sake of Allah has in fact completed faith.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 10, p. 177, no. 77]
