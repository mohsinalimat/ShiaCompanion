Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘He upon whom are great bounties from Allah, people’s needs from him increase accordingly. So, seek continuity in your bounties through tolerating the provisions, and do not let them cease, for it is seldom that one’s bounties cease and return to him again.’
[al-Kafi, v. 4, p. 37, no. 1]
