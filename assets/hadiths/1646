Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Do not stand for prayer lazily, drowsily or sluggishly for verily these are from among the disturbances brought about by hypocrisy, and verily Allah has prohibited the believers from standing for prayer while they are intoxicated, which means when intoxicated by sleep.’
[Tafsir al-`Aayyashi, v. 1, p. 242, no. 134]
