Imam al-Hasan (AS) said in answer to a man who said to him, ‘Verily I am one of your Shi`aa’, ‘O `Aabdallah, if you are truly obedient to us in our commands and prohibitions, then you are telling the truth. But if not, then do not add to your sins by falsely claiming such a dignified position that you are not worthy of. Do not say, ‘I am one of your Shi`aa’, but say rather, ‘I am one of your adherents and one of your lovers and an enemy to your enemies.’ You are [doing] good and aiming towards good.’
[Tanbih al-Khawatir, v. 2, p. 106]
