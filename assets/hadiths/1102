Imam al-Baqir (AS) was once asked a question by a man, to which he duly replied, and to which the man then retorted, ‘The jurists do not say this!’ The Imam said, ‘Woe unto you! Have you ever seen a jurist?! A real jurist is a person who is ascetic from this world, who craves for the Hereafter, and strongly holds onto the tradition of the Prophet (SAWA).’
