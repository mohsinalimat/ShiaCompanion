Imam Ali (AS) was once asked by a Jew, ‘When did our Lord, Mighty and Exalted, come to be?’, to which he replied, ‘O Jew, It is not that our Lord was not and then came to be, for the question ‘When did x come to be?’ is posed regarding something that is not there and then comes to be. He exists without coming into being; He is ever existing having nothing before Him. He is before ‘before’ itself, before any limit. Limits do not apply to Him for He is the ultimate limit of all limits.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 331, no. 18]
