Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in his supplication, ‘So how can I ever achieve thanksgiving?! For my thanking You requires thanksgiving in itself. Whenever I say, ‘To You belongs Praise [Thanks]’, it becomes thereby incumbent upon me to say, ‘To You belongs Praise [Thanks].’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 94, p. 146, no. 21]
