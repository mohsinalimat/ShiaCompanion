Imam al-Jawad (AS) said, ‘There are four types of merits: the first is wisdom, and its basis is thinking. The second is chastity, and its basis is desire. The third is power, and its basis is anger. The fourth is justice, and its basis is moderation in the faculties of the self.’
[Kashf al-Ghamma, v. 3, p. 138]
