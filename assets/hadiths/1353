Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Singing (or music) is one of the things that Allah, Mighty and Exalted, has threatened to requite with the Fire, and this is the purport of Allah’s verse: “Among the people is he who buys diversionary words that he may lead [people] astray from Allah’s way without any knowledge, and he takes it in derision.”[ Qur’an 31:6]
