Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘He has not kept His earth free of a knowledgeable man whom all of creation need, who is well-versed with the means of salvation. Such [people] are very few in number, and Allah has expounded this among the communities of the prophets, and made them the example for those to come after them, when He said concerning the people of Noah: “And none believed with him except a few”[ Nur al-Thaqalayn, v. 2, p. 358, no. 90]
