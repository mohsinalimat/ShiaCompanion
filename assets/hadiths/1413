Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Lure your soul to worship, and be lenient towards it, and do not force it. Accept its excuse and take advantage of its vitality, except what has been prescribed for you as an obligation; for they must be performed, and carried out at their right time.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 69]
