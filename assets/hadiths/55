`Aamr b. Shu’ayb narrated, on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather, that some people spoke about a man in the presence of the Prophet (SAWA), saying, ‘He does not eat unless he is fed, and does not go out unless a mount is made ready for him.’ So the Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘You have talked about him behind his back’ to which they replied, ‘O Prophet of Allah, we have only said what is true!’ so he exclaimed, ‘It is bad enough to talk about your brother regarding what is true [let alone what is false]!’
