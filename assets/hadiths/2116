Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, 'Your quest to secure your means of subsistence should be such that it is neither like the earning of a wasteful squanderer, nor like the greedy man who loves and depends on this world. Rather, you must raise yourself from the level of weakness and incapacity, and bring yourself down [from the level of greed] to the level of an equitable and virtuous man, and seek your earning the way a believer should.â€™
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 103, p. 33, no. 63]
