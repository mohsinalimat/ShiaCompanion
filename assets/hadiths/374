The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'Shall I tell you who is the toughest and strongest from among you?’ They replied, ‘Yes, O Prophet of Allah, do tell us’, so the Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘The strongest and toughest of you is he who, when he is happy, his happiness does not lead him to committing a sin or anything wrong, and when he gets angry, his anger does not prevent him from speaking the truth, and when he is empowered in any way, he does not take hold of that which is not lawfully his.’
