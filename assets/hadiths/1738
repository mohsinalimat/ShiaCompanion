Imam al-Baqir (AS), with regards to Allah’ s verse “We have attached every person’ s omen to his neck”, said, ‘The good and the evil he has done is with him wherever he is, and he cannot separate them until he is given his book about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection.’
[Tafsir al-Qummi, v. 2, p. 17]
