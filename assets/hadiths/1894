Imam Ali (AS) in his counsel to his son al-?asan (AS) said, ‘Your request [from Allah] must be for such as will aid you of the things whose beauty and goodness will remain for you and whose evil consequences will not touch you, and wealth will neither remain for you, and nor will you remain for it.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 205, no. 1]
