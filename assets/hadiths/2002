Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Look at the world through the eyes of those who have renounced it, for verily its inhabitants are quick to depart it and its opulence inflicts distress. So do not allow the abundance of what amazes you therein to deceive you, for it is but a little that you will take with you thereof.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 20, no. 79]
