The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'If a man has a wife who mistreats him, Allah does not accept her daily prayer, nor any other good deed she performs, even if she was to fast all her life, until and unless she relieves him and pleases him…and the husband will bear the same burden and punishment if he mistreats or oppresses his wife.’
[Wasael al-Shi`aah , v. 14, p. 116, no. 1]
