Imam al-Sadiq (AS) was once asked regarding the Prophet (SAWA)’ s saying, ‘Looking at the faces of scholars is an act of worship’ , to which he replied, ‘It refers to the scholar whom looking at reminds you of the Hereafter, and whoever is not thus, then looking at him is a trial.’
[Tanbih al-Khawatir, v. 1, p. 84]
