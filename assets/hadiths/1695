The Prophet (SAWA) narrated, ‘Verily when Moses, son of Amran (AS) would engage in intimate supplication with his Lord, he said, ‘My Lord, are you so far from me that I should call You, or are You so near to me that I should whisper?’ so Allah then revealed to Moses, ‘I sit in close proximity with the one who remembers Me.’
