Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Our Shi`aa are of three types: one type dupe people in our name, one type are like glass which discloses everything that is inside it [that they, like glass, cannot keep hidden that which is placed in their trust, like secrets (ed.)], and one type are like red gold, which the more it is brandished in the fire, the purer it becomes.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 186, no. 24]
