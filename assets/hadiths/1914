Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘O `Aabd al-A`ala, … give my greetings of peace and the mercy of Allah to my Shi`aa, and tell them: ‘Allah has mercy on the servant who incites love in the people towards himself and towards us [when attracting them towards Islam], by displaying to them that which they already like, and keeping from them that which they would reject.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 2, p. 77, no. 62]
