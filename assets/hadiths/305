Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Do not give charity openly for people to see and commend you for it, for verily when you do that, you have already received your reward for it [in their commendation]. However, if you give with your right hand such that your left hand does not come to know it, then the One for whose sake you have secretly given charity will surely reward you for it openly.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 284, no. 1]
