Imam Ali (AS) said, 'Whoever trusts time is betrayed by it, whoever attaches great importance to it is abased by it, whoever is angry with time, it spites him even more, and whoever takes refuge with time is forsaken by it. Not everyone who throws hits the target. When the sultan changes so does the time.â€™
