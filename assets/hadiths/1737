Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘When the Day of Resurrection comes, a caller will announce [on Allah’ s behalf], ‘Where are those who obstructed My friends’ and a group of people with no flesh on their faces will stand, and it will be said of them, ‘These are the people who troubled the believers, who declared enmity towards them, who opposed them and treated them harshly because of their religion.’ Then they will be ordered into Hell.’
