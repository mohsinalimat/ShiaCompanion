Imam Sadiq [a.s.] said: "He (Al-Mahdi) will stay (in a place close to the Kabah) between the Pillar and the Standing place (of Abraham) and will call out saying: "O' group of my administrators and the prominent people of mine whom Allah has stored preparing for my triumph before my advent over the face of the earth! Come to me obediently." Then, his call will reach them while they are in their praying places and at home in their beds whether in the East of the Earth or in its West. So, they hear him with this single call which reaches the ears of every one, and, they totally respond (by coming to him) as well. Then, it takes for them but a moment that all of them gather there, between the Pillar and the Standing-place (of Abraham), attending him [a.s.]." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 53, p. 7
