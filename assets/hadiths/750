Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Whoever clings onto Allah being wary of his duty to Him, Allah will protect him, and whoever Allah comes to protect should not worry even if the sky was to fall onto the earth, or if a calamity was to descend onto the earth and tribulation was to encompass everyone, he will be in the protection of Allah from every tribulation as a result of his Godwariness. Does Allah Almighty not say: "Indeed the Godwary will be in a secure place."[ Qur’an 44:51].’
