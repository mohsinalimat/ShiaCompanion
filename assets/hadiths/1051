Imam al-Sadiq (AS), in answer to the reason behind the superiority of a believer’s intention over his action, ‘Because an action could be done as an act of showing-off, but the intention is solely and sincerely for the Lord of the worlds, so He Almighty gives according to the intention what He does not give for the action.’
[`AeIlal al-Shara’i`a, p. 524, no. 2]
