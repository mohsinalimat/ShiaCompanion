The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'The lawful is evidently clear, and the unlawful is evidently clear, and obscurities fall between these two. He who abandons these obscurities is saved from the prohibited things, whereas one who delves into obscurities also ends up committing prohibited acts and falls into disaster whence he knows not.â€™
