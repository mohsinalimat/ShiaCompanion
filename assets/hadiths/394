Imam Ali (AS), in his will to Imam al-Hasan (AS) said, ‘My son, know that you have been created for the next world and not for this world, and for annihilation and not to stay, for death and not for life; you are in a transient place, a place which is a path to the Hereafter. You are driving away a death from which no one can run away and which none of its seekers can miss. It has to be experienced so beware lest it catches up with you while you are in a bad state. You should avert your self about it through repentance and it will intervene between you and it, instead of letting yourself perish.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 31]
