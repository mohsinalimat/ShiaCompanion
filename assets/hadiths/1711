Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Make your remembrance of Allah for the sake of the fact that He remembers you, for verily He remembers you even though He is needless of you, so His remembrance of you is loftier, more desirable and more complete than your remembrance of Him and it supersedes it…so whoever wishes to remember Allah, most High, should know that as long as Allah does not remember His servant in the context of granting him divine succour to remember Him [in the first place], the servant will not be capable of remembering Him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 93, p. 158, no. 33]
