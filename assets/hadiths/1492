It is narrated in Tanbih al-Khawatir that a bedouin once asked the Prophet, ‘O Prophet of Allah, who will hold creation to account on the Day of Resurrection’ to which he replied, ‘Allah, Mighty and Exalted.’ He said, ‘By the Lord of the Ka’ ba, we will be saved indeed!’ The Prophet asked, ‘And how is that O bedouin friend’ He replied, ‘Because the Generous One will pardon since He has the power to do so.’ [Tanbih al-Khawatir, v. 1, p. 9]
