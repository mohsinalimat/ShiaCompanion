Imam al-Sadiq (AS), when asked about the status of a person who lies when he speaks, who breaks promises when he makes them, and who betrays trusts when entrusted with them, replied, ‘These are the lowest of the states of disbelief, even though he may not be a disbeliever.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 290, no. 5]
