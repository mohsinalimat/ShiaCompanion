It is narrated in Da`aa’im al-Islam that when Imam Ali (AS) used to stand for prayer, he would be like a fixed structure or a straight pillar, not moving at all, and sometimes when he would bow or prostrate, [he would be so still that] a bird would perch itself on him. Nobody was ever able to match the prayer of the Prophet (SAWA) apart from Ali b. Abi Talib and Ali b. al-Husayn [i.e. Imam Zayn al-Abidin] (AS).’
