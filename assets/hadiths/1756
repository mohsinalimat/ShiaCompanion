Imam Ali (AS) said, 'So take a lesson from how Allah dealt with Iblis [Satan], when He thwarted his great works and his extensive efforts [because of the vanity of a single moment] even though he had been worshipping Allah for six thousand years, each hour of which was so long that it is not known whether they were years by the reckoning of this world or the next.â€™
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 192]
