The Prophet (SAWA), when a Jew asked him about the reason for him being called Muhammad, Ahmad, Abu al-Qasim, Bashir, Nadhir, and Da`ai - he replied, ‘As for Muhammad, I am praised [mahmud] in this earth, and Ahmad is that I am praised in the Heaven. As for Abu al-Qasim, Allah will divide the Day of Resurrection into two parts; the part (qisma) of Hell, and those who disbelieve in me from among the first ones to the last ones will be in the Hellfire; and the part of Heaven, and whoever believes in me from among the first ones to the last ones, and has acknowledged my prophethood will be in Heaven. Al-Da`ai [the caller] is that I call people to the religion of my Lord Almighty. Al-Nadhir [the warner] is that I warn people who disobey me about the Hellfire. Al-Bashir [bringer of good news] is that I bring the good news of Heaven to those who obey me.’
