In his speech on the day of Ashura’ said, ‘Beware! Now this impostor, son of the impostor [i.e. Ubaydullah b. Ziyad, son of Ziyad b. Abih]  has cornered me between two things: between unsheathing the swords, and bearing humiliation. And far be it that we accept humiliation. Verily Allah, His Prophet, the believers, the sacred and pure laps which have nursed us and which abhor disgrace, have all refused that obedience to the ignoble men be chosen over an honourable death.’
— Imam Husayn (a), al-Luhuf
