Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, 'He who refuses to pay the alms-tax, on the Day of Resurrection Allah will transform his wealth into a cobra with two venom glands that will coil itself around him and be told, 'Tighten your grip on him just as he was tight-fisted with you in the world.’ This is in accordance with Allah's verse in the Qur'an: "They will be collared with what they grudge…"[ Qur'an 3:180]
