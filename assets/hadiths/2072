Abil-Jarud said: "I asked Imam Baqir [a.s.] whether he knew about my love and sincerity for him and he answered he did. Then, I said I had a question for him to answer me, for my eyes were blind and I scarcely walked, so I could not always go to visit him. He wanted me to express my question. I requested him to inform me of the creed by which he and his household adored Allah, Almighty and Glorious, so that I could worship Him, too, by it. He responded: 'You asked a great thing, though you stated a short expression. By Allah, I give you (your answer of) my religion and the religion of my fathers by which we worship Allah, Almighty and Glorious. It is: the confession of faith that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad [p.b.u.h.] is the Messenger of Allah, with affirmation that what has come to him (the Qur'an) is from Allah, having affection (for us and) for the lovers and obedients to us (AhIul Bayt) and hatred to our enemies, surrender to our cause, awaiting our Qaim (the twelveth Imam, for whom there is a domination that will come whenever Allah wills), and endeavouring (for establishing divine obligatories and lawful matters) and being pious, (with avoiding unlawful things)'."
