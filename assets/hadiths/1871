Imam Ali (AS) when he was asked regarding Allah’s verse: “Call Me and I will hear you[r supplications]” - ‘So why does it happen that we supplicate and are not answered?’ - replied, ‘Because your hearts have been treacherous in eight areas, the first of them being that you know Allah but you do not fulfil your right towards Him as is obligatory upon you, so your inner knowledge of Him has not benefited you at all… so then which supplication will be answered for you with this [state of affairs] after you have blocked its doors and paths?!’
