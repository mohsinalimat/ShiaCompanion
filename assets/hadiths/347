Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Do not express malicious gloating at your brother [for a sin or misfortune] for Allah will have mercy on him as a result and make it befall you instead.’ He also said, ‘He who gloats over an affliction that has befallen his brother will not leave this world until he has been tried similarly.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 359, no. 1]
