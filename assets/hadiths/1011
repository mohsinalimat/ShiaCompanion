Imam al-Sadiq (AS) asked a man who said ‘Allah is Greater’ (Allahu Akbar), ‘Greater than what?’ So the man replied, ‘Greater than everything’, to which Imam (AS) retorted, ‘Then you have defined Him.’ The man then asked him, ‘So what should I say?’ Imam replied, ‘Say: Allah is too great for description.’
