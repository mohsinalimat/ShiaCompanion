Imam al-Sadiq (AS) was once asked why the one who abandons the prayer is considered an infidel and not the fornicator, to which he replied, ‘Because the fornicator and other [such sinners] commits the sin out of a desire that overcomes him, whereas the one who abandons the prayer only does so because he does not take it seriously, deeming it insignificant.’
