Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The Shi`aa are of three types: one type who loves us and shows affection towards us, and he is one of us. The other type is he who adorns himself through us, and we will serve as an adornment for whoever adorns himself through us. And the third type seeks to cheat people and enrich himself in our name, and whoever does this will be impoverished.’
