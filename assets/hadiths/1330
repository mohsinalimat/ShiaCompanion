Imam Ali (AS), describing the Prophet (SAWA), said, ‘He had the most generous of hands, and his chest was the boldest of all. He was the most truthful of people in speech and the most trustworthy in liability. He was the most lenient of people in disposition, and the kindest of them in social companionship. Those who saw him would spontaneously respect him, and those who associated with him and came to know him loved him. I have never seen anyone like him, before him or after him (SAWA).’
