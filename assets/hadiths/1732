The Prophet (SAWA), with regards to Allah’ s verse “The Day We shall gather the Godwary toward the All-beneficent, as incoming guests”[ Qur’ an 1985], said, ‘Verily these incoming guests will only enter mounted. They are the men who were wary of their duty to Allah, so Allah loved them, distinguished them and is well-pleased with their deeds, and has therefore named them the Godwary.’
