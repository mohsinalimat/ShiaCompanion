The believer has seven rights incumbent upon his fellow believer which are made obligatory by Allah, Mighty and Exalted, and about which Allah will ask him what he did: to esteem him highly in his eyes, to entertain love for him in his heart, to assist him financially from his own wealth, to love for him what he loves for himself, to prohibit [others] from backbiting him, to visit him in his sickness, to attend his funeral procession, and to not say anything but good about him after his death.
— Imam Sadiq (a), al-Khisal
