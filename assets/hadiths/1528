Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The perfection of a man lies in six features: in two of his smallest [features], in two of his largest [features], and in two of his apparent [features]. As for two of his smallest [features] - his heart and his tongue - when he fights he fights with his heart and when he speaks he speaks with his tongue. Two of his largest [features] are his intellect and his determination, and his two apparent [features] are his wealth and his beauty.’
