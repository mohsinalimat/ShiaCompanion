Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Even if falsehood was isolated from being mixed with the truth, it would not be indefinable by those who aspire it; and even if the truth was free from being disguised as falsehood, the tongues of its opponents would still be silenced; but it is often made by taking a little from one and a little from the other.’
[Sharhe Nahj al-Balagha li Ibn Abi al-Hadid, v. 3, p. 240]
