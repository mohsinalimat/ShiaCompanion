Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily when Allah, Blessed and most High, wishes to requite his servant with evil [as a result of his deeds], He will take him to account for them in front of everyone, and will reduce him to tears [on account of the proofs against him], and will give him his book in his left hand, and this is the purport of Allah’ s verse “But as for him who is given his record from behind his back, he will pray for annihilation, and he will enter the Blaze. Indeed he used to be joyful among his folk” [Qur’ an 8410-13] [al-Zuhd li al-Husayn b. Sa`aid, p. 92, no. 246]
