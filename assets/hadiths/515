Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Verily the enjoinment of good and the prohibition of wrong is the path of the prophets, the way of the righteous, a great obligation on which all other obligations are founded and on which ideologies are secured, by which earnings are made lawful, by which iniquities are redressed, through which the earth flourishes, justice is sought from enemies and [Allah’s] command is kept upright.’
[al-Kafi, v. 5, p. 56, no. 1]
