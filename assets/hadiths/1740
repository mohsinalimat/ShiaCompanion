Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘When the Day of Resurrection comes, man will be handed his book and told, ‘Read it.’ [The reporter of the tradition then asked him], ‘And will he know what is in it’ to which he replied, ‘Verily he will remember it. There will not remain a single moment, a single word, a single footstep or anything that he did which he will not remember, as if he had done it that very hour. And this is why they will say, “Woe to us! What a book this is! It omits nothing, big or small, without enumerating it.” [Tafsir al-`Aayyashi, no. 34]
