Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Gabriel (AS) came to him three times with the keys of the treasuries of the earth, giving him the choice without Allah Almighty lessening anything of what He had prepared for him on the Day of Judgment. So, he chose humbleness to his Lord, the Exalted and Mighty.’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 130, no. 100]
