Hamza b. `Aabdullah b. `Autba said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) had characteristics that did not exist in tyrants. There was no red or black person who called him except that he answered. Sometimes he would find a date fallen on the ground and he would pick it up and throw it in his mouth, and he would fear that it might be from charity. He would also ride a donkey that was barebacked and did not have anything on it [i.e. a saddle].’
