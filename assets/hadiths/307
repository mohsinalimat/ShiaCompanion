Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily charity given at night [i.e. secretly in the dark of the night] extinguishes the wrath of the Lord, wipes away grave sins and facilitates one’s account [on the Day of Resurrection]. Charity given during the day [in broad daylight] makes one’s wealth thrive and increases one’s lifespan.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 96, p. 125, no. 39]
