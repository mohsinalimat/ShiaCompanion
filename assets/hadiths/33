Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘A plant grows in a plain-levelled land and does not grow in a hard rocky place. The same goes for wisdom, as it grows in the humble heart and does not grow in the arrogant haughty heart; for Allah has made humbleness the tool for the intellect, and made arrogance the tool for ignorance. Do you not know that he who turns his head up towards the ceiling will break it, and he who lowers his head will be shaded and sheltered underneath it?! Thus, Allah will abase one who is not humble before Him, and Allah will elevate whoever is humble for Him.’
[Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, p. 396]
