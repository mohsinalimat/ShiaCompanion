Imam Ali (AS), in his advice to Kumayl said, ‘O Kumayl, you cannot ever be devoid of the bounties of Allah and the good health [given to you by Him], so do not remain without praising Him, exalting Him, glorifying Him, sanctifying Him, thanking Him and remembering Him in every situation.’
[Bashara al-Mustafa, p. 28]
