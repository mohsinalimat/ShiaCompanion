Imam al-Sadiq (AS), with regards to Allah’s verse ‘Read your book! Today your soul suffices as your own reckoner’ , said, ‘The servant will be reminded of everything that he had done and that was recorded against him, as if he had done it that very hour, and because of that they will say, “Woe to us! What a book this is! It omits nothing, big or small, without enumerating it!”[ Qur’ an 1849]- [Tafsir al-`Aayyashi, v. 2, p. 328, no. 35]
