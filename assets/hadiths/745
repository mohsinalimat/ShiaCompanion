Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘He who adopts Godwariness…dignity will pour down on him after having been scarce; mercy will incline towards him after having missed him [previously], blessings will gush onto him after having been barren, and benediction will heavily rain upon him after having merely drizzled.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 198]
