Goodness does not lie in the increase of your wealth and of your progeny, rather goodness lies in the increase of your knowledge, and the heightening of your clemency, and in your vying with other people in the worship of Allah. If you do good then you should praise Allah, but if you commit evil then seek forgiveness from Allah.
— Imam Ali (a), Nahj al-Balagha
