Imam Ali (AS) asked Nawf al-Bakali, ‘Do you know who my Shi`aa are, Nawf?’ to which he replied, ‘By Allah, no.’ Imam replied, ‘My Shi`aa have parched lips and empty stomachs. They are those whose faces disclose asceticism, for they are ascetics by night, lions by day.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 28, no. 95]
