Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Fatima (AS) had some barley which she made into a sweet paste. When they had finished cooking it and placed it on the table, a poor man came and said, ‘May Allah have mercy upon you.’ So Ali (AS) stood up and gave him a third of it. Soon afterwards, an orphan came and said, ‘May Allah have mercy upon you.’ Ali (AS) stood up and gave him a third. Soon afterwards, a prisoner of war came and said, ‘May Allah have mercy upon you.’ So Ali (AS) gave him the last third, and they did not even taste it. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verses honouring them, and they apply to every believer who does the same for the sake of Allah, the Exalted.
