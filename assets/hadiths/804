Imam al-Ridha (AS) said, ‘Instruct the child to give charity with his own hand, be it a piece of bread or a handful of [food] or any other small thing, for everything - no matter how little it is - if done for the sake of Allah and with an honest intention is very great.’
[al-Kafi, v. 4, p. 4, no. 10]
