Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in one of his supplications, 'Were it not for the fact that Satan misleads them from Your obedience, no disobeyer would have ever disobeyed You, and were it not for the fact that he portrays falsehood to them in the likeness of truth, no strayer would have ever strayed from Your path.â€™
[al-Sahifat al-Sajjadiyya, supplication 37, line 144]
