Imam al-Sadiq (AS) was once asked whether one should give charity to those who beg at people’s doors, or whether to withhold it from them and give it to one’s poor relatives instead, to which he replied, ‘No, rather one should send it to a [poor] relative, for that holds a greater reward.’
[Thawab al-A`amal, p. 171, no. 20]
