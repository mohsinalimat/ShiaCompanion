Imam Baqir [a.s.] said: "When our Qaim rises, sets his hand (authority) over the heads of the servants, then, he will give them intellectual development and complete their patience and insights. After that, Allah will extend their sights and their hearing so that there will be no barrier between them and the Qaim when he decides to speak with them, then they hear, and they can watch him while he is in his place." Yaumul Khalas, p. 269
