Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Verily Allah, most High, will certainly interrogate you, O community of His servants, about your actions, be they small or big, and be they open or secret. If He punishes you, then it because you have wronged yourselves, and if He pardons, then it is because He is too generous.’ [Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 27]
