The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘On the Day of Resurrection, pulpits will be set up around the Throne for my Shi`aa and the Shi`aa of my household, who are sincere in their adherence to our guardianship. Then Allah, Mighty and Exalted, will say, ‘Hurry to Me My servants that I may spread My Magnanimity over you, for you have been hurt in the world.’
