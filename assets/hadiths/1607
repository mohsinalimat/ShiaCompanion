The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Verily the pillar of religion is the prayer. It is the first thing to be considered from amongst the deeds of man, so if his prayer is valid, the rest of his deeds will be considered, and if his prayer is void, then the rest of his deeds will not be taken into consideration.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 82, p. 227, no. 54]
