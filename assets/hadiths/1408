Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Beware O beware of obeying your leaders and your elders who felt proud of their achievements and boasted about their lineage … and do not obey those who claim to be Muslims [but are hypocrites] whose filth you imbibe alongside your propriety, whose ailments you mix with your healthiness, and whose wrongs you have allowed to infiltrate your rightful matters, while they are the very foundation of vice.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 192]
