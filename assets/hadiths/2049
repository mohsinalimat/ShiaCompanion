Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘From among [the matters of] wisdom is to avoid dispute with one who is above you, to not disesteem anyone other than yourself, to not undertake a task which is outside of your capability, to not have your tongue contradict your heart and neither your word [contradict] your action, to not speak of that which you do not know, and to not abandon a matter as it approaches only to pursue it as it retreats.’
