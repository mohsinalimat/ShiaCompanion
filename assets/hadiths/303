Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Among the best means by which those who seek nearness to Allah may have recourse to His nearness, Blessed and most High, are: faith in Him and in His messenger …, giving charity secretly for verily it atones for one’s misdeeds, and giving charity openly for verily it protects against an undignified death.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 110]
