Every aspect of this world seems greater upon hearing than when it is seen, and every aspect of the Hereafter is greater when it will be seen than when it is heard about. So be satisfied with the hearing in lieu of the seeing and with the tale in lieu of the concealed [regarding the Hereafter and the unseen you should be content with what you hear and you are informed of by the prophets].
— Imam Ali (a), Nahj al-Balagha
