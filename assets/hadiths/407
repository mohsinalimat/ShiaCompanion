Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The remembrance of death kills the desires in the self and uproots the sources of inattentiveness. It strengthens the heart about Allah’s threats, softens one's attitude, breaks the pillars of inclinations, extinguishes the fire of greed, and it degrades the world.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 6, p. 133, no. 32]
