Imam al-Sadiq (AS), when asked to give proof that Allah is One, said, ‘The continuous unity of management [in the cosmos] and the perfection of creation, as Allah, Mighty and Exalted, has said, “Had there been gods in them (i.e. the heavens and the earth) other than Allah, they would surely have fallen apart”[ Qur’an 21:22].’
