Imam Mahdi [a.s.] wrote in a letter to Ash-Shaykh Al-Mufid: "We are not regardless of considering you nor are we forgetful of you, because if it were not so, afflictions would shower upon you and enemies would eradicate you. Hence, fear Allah and obey Him, Glory be to His Majesty." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 53, p. 175
