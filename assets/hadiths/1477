The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘If you are faced by anger, avert it through pardon, for verily a caller will call out on the Day of Resurrection ‘Whoever has a claim for a reward from Allah should stand up’ , and none will stand except the pardoners. Have you not heard the verse of Allah, most High, “So whoever pardons and conciliates, his reward lies with Allah”! [A`alam al-Din, no. 337]
