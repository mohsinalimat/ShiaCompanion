The Prophet (SAWA) was asked by Abu Dharr how to maintain the mosques, to which he replied, 'Voices should not be raised therein, nor engrossment in wrongdoing. There should be no buying or selling, and all vain talk must be shunned as long as you are inside. If you do not do this, then you will have no one to blame but yourself on the Day of Resurrection.â€™
