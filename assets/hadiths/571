Imam Ali (AS), in his letter to Malik al-Ashtar said, ‘…be fair for Allah and be fair to people in spite of yourself, and in spite of your close members of your family, and in spite of those towards whom you have inclinations from among your followers, for if you do not do so you will be oppressing.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 53]
