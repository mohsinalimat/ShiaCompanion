Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘He who talks about someone behind his back, mentioning what is true about him, and what people already know, then he has not backbit about him, whereas he who talks about someone behind his back about something that is true but that people do not know about, then he has backbit about him.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 358, no. 6]
