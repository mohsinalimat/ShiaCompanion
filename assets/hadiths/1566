The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘O Ibn Mas`aud, if people praise you, saying, ‘You fast the day and stay awake at night’, and you do not actually do so then do not feel happy about it, for Allah Almighty says, "Do not suppose those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done, do not suppose them saved from punishment, and there is a painful punishment for them." [Qur’an 3:188] [Makarim al-Akhlaq, v. 2, p. 353, no. 2660]
