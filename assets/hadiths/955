Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in his supplication, 'â€¦and divert our hearts from every other act of remembrance through Your remembrance, our tongues from every other act of thanksgiving through [being preoccupied with] thanking You, our limbs from every other act of obedience through [being preoccupied with] obedience to You! If You have ordained for us idleness in an occupation, make it an idleness of safety, wherein no ill consequence visits us nor weariness overtakes us as a result! Then the writers of evil deeds may depart from us with a page empty of the mention of our evil deeds, and the writers of good deeds may leave us happy with the good deeds of ours which they have written.'[al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, Supplication 11]
