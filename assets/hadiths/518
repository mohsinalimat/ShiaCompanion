Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The one who contents himself with the wrong action of a group of people is as one who plunges into it with them, and every person who plunges into wrongdoing is guilty of two sins: the sin of having committed the wrong and the sin of being content with it.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 254]
