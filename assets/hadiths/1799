The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘As for self-restraint, from it branches out satisfaction, resignation, good fortune, comfort, a sense of evaluation, humbleness, a sense of remembrance, contemplation, magnanimity and generosity. These are the many ramifications for the intelligent man who practices self-restraint and is satisfied with Allah and with his share.’
