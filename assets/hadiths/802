Imam Ali (AS) said to Imam al-Hasan (AS), ‘The heart of a youth resembles an empty land - it receives all that is thrown into it. This is why I have started to teach you good manners before your heart is hardened and your soul is preoccupied.’
[Sharhe Nahj al-Balagha li Ibn Abi al-Hadid, v. 16, p. 66]
