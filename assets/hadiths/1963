Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Verily Allah - glory be to Him - has made this world for what is after it and has put its inhabitants to trial so that He may know who from among them has the best deeds, and we have not been created for this world, nor have we been commanded to strive for it.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 55]
