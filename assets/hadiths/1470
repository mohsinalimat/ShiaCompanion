Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘Adhere to the Qur’an …for Allah has created Paradise, and has made its stations in accordance with the verses of the Qur'an. So whoever reads the Qur'an, it will say to him, ‘Read and ascend!’ So whoever from among them enters Paradise, there will not be a station higher than theirs except for the prophets and the truthful ones.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 8, p. 133, no. 39]
