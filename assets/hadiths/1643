Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The prayer of a Haqin, a Haqib and a HAziq does not count - a Haqin is one who suppresses the urge to urinate, a Haqib is one who suppresses the urge to defecate [before commencing the prayer], and a Haziq is one whose feet are pinched by wearing narrow shoes.’
[Amali al-Saduq, p. 337, no. 12]
