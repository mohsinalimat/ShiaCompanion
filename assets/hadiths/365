Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Be content with what Allah has allotted for you, do not look at what others have, and do not wish for what you cannot acquire, for whoever is content will be full and whoever is not content will never be full, and take your portion of your Hereafter.’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 243, no. 337]
