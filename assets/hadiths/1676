Imam al-Sadiq (AS), in his advice to his children heralding the advent of the month of Ramadhan, said, 'Exert yourselves [in doing good deeds] for verily in this month sustenance is apportioned, life spans are destined, the names of Allah's select servants who wish to strive towards Him are recorded down, and in this month is a night wherein the good deeds performed equal the deeds of a thousand months.â€™
