Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, 'Giving the alms-tax at the end of the month of Ramazan constitutes fasting just as sending blessings on the Prophet (SAWA) at the end of the prayer completes and constitutes the prayer. Verily the one who fasts and yet intentionally does not pay the alms-tax due, his fasting is invalid.â€™
