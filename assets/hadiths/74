Imam Ali (AS) said, 'Those who restrain themselves from worldly pleasures are such that their hearts are weeping though outwardly they may laugh, they experience great sorrow though they display joy, and they are filled with self-contempt though they rejoice at all that they have been bestowed.â€™
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 113]
