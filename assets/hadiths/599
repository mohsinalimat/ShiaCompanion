Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘A servant will never savour the taste of faith until he knows that that which afflicts him would never have missed him, and that that which has missed him would never have touched him, and that the only One to induce harm and benefit is Allah, Mighty and Exalted.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 58, no. 7]
