Imam Ali (AS), when asked about the characteristics of the Prophet (SAWA) while he was sitting with his legs tucked under his sword-belt in the mosque of Kufa, said, ‘The messenger of Allah (SAWA) had white skin tinted with redness, with large black eyes, abundant lank hair, a thick beard, flat hairy cheeks, fine hair on his chest. His neck was [white] like a silver pitcher, he had hair from the top of his chest to his belly flowing like a sword, and he did not have any other hair on his stomach or chest. He had thick hands and feet, when he walked he walked fast and when he stood up it was like he had been erected from a rock. When he turned he would turn his whole body. The perspiration on in his face was like pearls, and the scent of his perspiration was more fragrant than strong musk. He was neither short nor tall, nor was he frail, nor avaricious. I have never seen someone like him (SAWA) before him or after him.’
