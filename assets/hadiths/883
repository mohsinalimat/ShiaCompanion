The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘A hypocrite is someone who when he makes a promise he does not fulfil it, when he does something [bad], he discloses it, when he speaks he lies, when he is entrusted with something he betrays, when he is given sustenance he is fickle and thoughtless, and when he is deprived he spends [more].’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 72, p. 207, no. 8]
