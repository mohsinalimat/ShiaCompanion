The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'Whoever patiently tolerates and puts up with his wife's bad character [for the sake of Allah], for every day and night of his endurance Allah will grant him the same reward as that granted to Prophet Job (AS) for enduring his afflictions, and for every day and night of her evildoing she will bear a burden as heavy as the sandhills of Arabia.â€™
