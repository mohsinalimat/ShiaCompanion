Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The promise of a believer to his brother is a vow for which there is no [prescribed] penance, so he who breaks a promise first disappoints Allah, and subjects himself to His discontentment, as Allah says: "O you who have faith! Why do you say what you do not do?"[ Qur’an 61:2] [al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 363, no. 1]
