Ammara narrated, ‘I asked Aba Abdillah [al-Sadiq] [as] as to why Fatima has been named al-Zahra’, to which he replied, ‘Because when she stood for prayers in her prayer niche, her light would radiate for the dwellers of the skies jut as the light of the stars radiates for the dwellers of the earth.
