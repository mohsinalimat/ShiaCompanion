Prophet Jesus (AS) said, ‘When an animal is not mounted, trained or used it will become hard to use and its character will change. The same goes for the hearts - if they are not made soft with the remembrance of death, followed by diligent worship, they will harden and become harsh.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 14, p. 309, no. 17]
