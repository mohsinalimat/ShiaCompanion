Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Our Shi`aa are none other than those who are consciously wary of their duty to Allah and obey Him. They are known solely for their humbleness, their humility, their returning promptly whatever is entrusted in their care and their Abundant remembrance of Allah.’
[Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, p. 295]
