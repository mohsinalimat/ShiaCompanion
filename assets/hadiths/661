The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'Allah's wrath is indeed severe on the married woman who fulfils her desires through any other man apart from her husband or looks lustfully at anyone other than her unmarriageable kin [i.e. husband], upon which Allah thwarts every single good deed she has ever committed. And if she welcomes anyone other than her husband in his bed, Allah will rightfully burn her in the Fire after He has chastised her in her grave.â€™
