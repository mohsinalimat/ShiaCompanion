Imam Ali (AS) said, 'The obscure matter has been termed obscure for the very fact that it resembles [and therefore obscures] the truth. The friends of Allah take recourse in conviction as their light therein and the direction of the right path itself as their guide, whereas the enemies of Allah use it to call [others] to deviation and blind following is their guide therein.â€™
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 38]
