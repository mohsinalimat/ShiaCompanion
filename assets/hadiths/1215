Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘That which Allah helps [expose] the liars with is their own forgetfulness.’
[meaning that forgetfulness becomes a way of exposing them, whereby they may lie about something and forget what it is they had said, and then say something contrary to what they had first said (as quoted from the footnote of the source reference)] [al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 341, no. 15]
