Imam Ali (AS) said in his will to his son, al-Hasan (AS), ‘And know my son that if your Lord were to have a partner, his messengers would surely have come to you, and you would have seen the signs of his dominion and his power, and you would know his acts and his attributes. He, however, is One God, just as He as described Himself. He is neither opposed by anyone in His kingdom, nor will He ever cease to be.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 31]
