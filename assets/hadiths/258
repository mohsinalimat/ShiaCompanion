Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily Allah - Blessed and most High - distinguished the Prophet (SAWA) with noble moral traits, therefore examine yourselves and if you find them within yourselves, then praise Allah and beseech Him for an increase in them’, then the Imam listed ten of them, ‘Conviction, contentment, patience, thankfulness, clemency, excellent character, liberality, self-respect, courage and valour.’
