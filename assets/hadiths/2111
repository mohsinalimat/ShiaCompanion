Imam Ali (AS) said, 'Know that even if a servant was devoid of shrewdness and was feeble in his schemes, it would not reduce the amount of sustenance that Allah has apportioned for him, and even if a servant were to be skilfully shrewd and crafty, it would not do anything to increase the sustenance that Allah has apportioned for him.â€™
