Prophet Jesus (AS) said, 'Do not look intently at one who does not belong to you, for verily your genitals will not commit fornication as long as you guard your gaze [from fornicating]. So if you are able to keep yourself from looking at the apparel of a woman who is not permitted to you, then do so.â€™
[Tanbih al-Khawatir, p. 62]
