The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘There are three things that if are not present with someone then their actions are incomplete: piety preventing one from disobeying Allah, a character through which one is amicable towards people, and clemency with which to deal with the rashness of the ignorant.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 116, no. 1]
