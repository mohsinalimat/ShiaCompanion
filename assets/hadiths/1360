The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'He who walks to a mosque asking people to join him along the way gets the equivalent of seventy thousand good deeds for every step he takes, and he is raised as many levels, and if he dies on the way, Allah assigns seventy thousand angels to visit him in his grave to keep him company in his loneliness and to seek forgiveness for him until the day he is raised again.â€™
