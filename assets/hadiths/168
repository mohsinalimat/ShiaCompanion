Abu al-Ahwal! Narrating from his father said, ‘I visited the Prophet (SAWA) and he saw me with a bad appearance, so the Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Do you own anything?’ I said, ‘Yes, all the wealth that Allah has given me.’ He (SAWA) said, ‘If you have wealth then it should be seen on you.’
[Sunan al-Nasa`ai, v. 8, p. 196]
