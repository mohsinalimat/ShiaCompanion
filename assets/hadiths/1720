Imam al-Baqir or Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The angel only writes down what he hears, but when Allah, Mighty and Exalted, has said, “And remember your Lord within your heart…”, no one knows the reward of that remembrance in the heart of the servant except Allah, most High.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 5, p. 322, no. 7]
