It is narrated in Misbah al-Shari`aa (The Lantern of the Path): ‘If there was to be an act of worship for Allah’s sincere servants to carry out better in the sight of Allah than thanksgiving to Him in every situation, He would have definitely singled out these worshippers for a mention from amongst the rest of creation for their carrying out this special act of worship. And for the very fact that there is no better act of worship than it [i.e. thanksgiving], He has distinguished it from all other acts of worship and has distinguished those who practice it, saying, “And very few of My servants are truly thankful.”[ Misbah al-Shari`aa, p. 55]
