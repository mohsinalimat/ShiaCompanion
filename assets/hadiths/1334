Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyya said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (SAWA) almost never said to something: ‘No’. When he was asked to do something that he wanted to do, he would say ‘Yes’, and if he was asked to do something that he did not want to do he would keep silent, and it [the answer] would be known from his silence.’
[al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, v. 1, p. 368]
