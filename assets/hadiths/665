The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'O Ali, there are six consequences that result from fornication, three of which are in this world and three in the Hereafter. In this world, it takes away one's beauty, hastens one's death and cuts off one's sustenance. In the Hereafter, it results in an evil reckoning, solicits the indignation of the Merciful Himself and makes one deserving of eternity in the Fire.â€™
