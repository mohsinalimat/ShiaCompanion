Imam al-Baqir (AS) said to Jabir b. Yazid al-Ju`afi, ‘Know that you will not be a friend of ours unless if all of your countrymen were to gather and claim that you are a bad person, it would not worry you, and if they were all to say that you are a good person, it would not make you any happier. Expose yourself to the Book of Allah, and if you follow its path, abstaining from that which it dictates to be abstained from, wanting what it wants, and fearing that which it frightens about, then be steadfast and rejoice, for what is said about you will not harm you. But if you are contrary to the Qur’an then what do you have to be proud about?’
