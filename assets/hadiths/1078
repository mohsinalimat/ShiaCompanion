The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Verily the closest from among you to me tomorrow [in the Hereafter], and the most eligible of you for my intercession are those who are the most truthful from amongst you, the most conscientious at returning a trust placed in their care, the most good-natured, and the ones who have close ties with people.’
[Amali al-Saduq, p. 411, no. 5]
