Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Godwariness is the remedy for the sickness of your hearts, the sight for the blindness of your hearts, the cure for the sickness of your bodies, the reformation of the corruption of your chests [souls], the purification of the filth of your souls, the enlightenment of the blindness of your eyes, the safety for the fear of your anxiety, and the light to the blackness of your darkness.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 198]
