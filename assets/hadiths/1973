The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Do not insult the world for it is the best mount for the believer, because by means of it he attains good and through it he is saved from evil. If a servant [of Allah] says: “May Allah curse the world”, the world replies: “May Allah curse the most disobedient one towards his Lord from among us!”.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 178, no. 10]
