Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘He upon whom the bounties of Allah are plenty, people’s needs from him increase accordingly. So, if he uses them for Allah in the way he must do so, He causes them to continue and remain. But if he does not use them in the way that he must, He will make them cease and perish.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 372]
