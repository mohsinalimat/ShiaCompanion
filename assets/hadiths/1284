Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘When the Day of Judgment comes Allah, Blessed and most High, will gather the first and the last of creation in one place. A caller will cry out, ‘Where are the people of merit?’ The Imam then said, ‘Then a handful of people will rise, and the angels will receive them asking them, ‘What were your merits?’ They will say, ‘We used to visit those who cut us off, give to those who deprived us, and forgive those who oppressed us.’ It will then be said to them, ‘You have spoken the truth. Enter Paradise.’
