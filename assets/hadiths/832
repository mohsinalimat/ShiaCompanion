Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Every aspect of this life seems greater upon hearing than when it is seen, and every aspect of the Hereafter is greater when it will be seen than when it is heard about. So be satisfied with the hearing in lieu of the seeing, and with the tale in lieu of the concealed.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 114]
