Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The people of Hell will dwell eternally in Hell because their intentions in the world were such that if they were to remain there forever they would disobey Allah forever, and the people of Heaven will dwell eternally in Heaven because their intentions in the world were such that if they were to remain there forever, they would obey Allah. Therefore, it is according to their intentions that these people and those people will have everlasting abodes. He then recited Allah’s verse in the Qur’an: "Say, ‘Everyone acts according to his character’ [Qur’an 17:84], and said, [meaning] ‘With his intention.’
