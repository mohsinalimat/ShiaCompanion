Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘O you who insult the world, who have been deceived by its deceit and cheated by its falsities, do you covet the world and then insult it? Should you accuse it or should it accuse you? When did it bewilder it or deceive you?!… Verily the world is an abode of truth for he who is truthful to it, an abode of wellbeing for he who understands it, and an abode of riches for he who collects provision from it [for the next world].’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying.131]
