Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, describing his father Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS), ‘He used to go out in the dark night carrying a sack on his back and going from door to door, knocking on each and giving to whoever came out to answer it. He used to cover his face when giving to the poor in order that they may not recognise him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 46, p. 89, no. 77]
