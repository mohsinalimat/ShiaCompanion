Imam al-Jawad (AS), when asked about death said, ‘It is the sleep that comes to you every night, however its period is long and none will wake from it until the Day of Resurrection. So he who sees in his sleep different kinds of happy states whose extent he cannot fathom and different kinds of terrors he cannot fathom, then how will the happiness and the dismay in death be? This is death so prepare for it.’
