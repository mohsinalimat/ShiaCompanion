Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘When Allah blesses His servant with bounties and it is manifest about him, he is called the beloved of Allah and a proclaimer of Allah's bounties, and when Allah blesses a servant with bounties and he does not show it, he is called one despised by Allah and a denier of Allah's bounties.’
[al-Kafi, v. 6, p. 438, no. 2]
