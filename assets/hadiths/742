The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘There is a characteristic that whoever adopts, the world and the Hereafter will obey him, and he will win with the victory of Heaven.’ He was asked, ‘What is it O Messenger of Allah (SAWA)?’ He said, ‘Godwariness. Whoever wants to be the most honourable of people should be wary of Allah Almighty.’ He then recited: "And whoever is wary of Allah, He shall make a way out for him, and provide for him from whence he does not reckon."[ Qur’an 65:2,3] [Bihar al-Anwar, v. 70, p. 275, no. 7]
