It is narrated in Bihar al-Anwar that Allah, most High, revealed to Prophet David (AS) saying, 'I want [something] and you want [something else], and verily only My will is done. Therefore, if you submit to what I want, I will suffice you in what you want. If you do not submit to My will, however, I will exhaust you in your quest for what you want, until only what I want will be.â€™
