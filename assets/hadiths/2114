The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'Verily the archangel Gabriel blew into my mind that no soul shall pass away before the depletion of his sustenance in this world, so be wary of your duty to Allah and seek your livelihood through decent means, and let not a delay in your provision cause any of you to seek it through unlawful means, for verily what is with Allah is only acquired through His obedience.â€™
