Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Shall I inform you of a true learned person? He who does not allow people to commit acts of disobedience to Allah, does not let them lose hope in the mercy of Allah, does not assure them against the devices of Allah, and does not leave the Quran in his desire for something other than it.’
[Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, p. 204]
