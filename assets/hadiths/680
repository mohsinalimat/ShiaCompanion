Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Do not call a man your friend with the true stamp of friendship until you have tested him in three matters: anger him so that you may see whether his anger takes him away from right into wrong; test him with the dinar and the dirham [in money matters]; and travel with him.’
[Amali al-Tusi, p. 646, no. 1339]
