The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘When someone supplicates, he should pray for everyone, for it renders his supplication more conducive to being answered, and whoever precedes forty from among his brothers in supplication before supplicating for himself, his supplication for them as well as himself will duly be answered.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 93, p. 313, no. 17]
