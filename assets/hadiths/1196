Imam al-Sadiq (AS), when asked by Hasan b. MaHbub, ‘Can a believer be miserly?’, replied, ‘Yes.’ [He said] I asked, ‘And can he be cowardly?’ The Imam replied, ‘Yes.’ I asked, ‘Can he be a liar?’ The Imam said, ‘No, and nor can he be a traitor.’ He then said, ‘A believer can be predisposed by nature for everything except treachery and lying.’ [Bihar al-Anwar, v. 75, p. 305, no. 1]
