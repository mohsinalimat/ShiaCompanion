Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘The Godwary people have the simplest of provisions in this world, but are the most helpful to you with their provisions, you only have to mention and they help you, and if you forget [your needs] they remind you. They are communicators of Allah’s commands, guardians over Allah’s commands, they have confined their love to loving their Lord. They feel estranged in the world in obedience to their Ruler; they look at Allah and His love with their hearts, and they know that they are looking at Him because of the magnitude of His Rank.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 133, no. 16]
