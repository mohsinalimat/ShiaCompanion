Imam Amir ul Mu'mineen Ali [a.s.] said: "When our Qaim rises, the sky will send down its drops, the earth will grow its plants, enmity will come out from the servants' hearts (in order that they live in peace and brotherly love), and savages and beasts will continue to live together peacefully...." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 52, p. 316
