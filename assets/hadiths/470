The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Allah Almighty said, ‘By My Might and Exaltedness…no sooner does a servant prefer his own desire over My desire than I disperse his affairs, cover him over with this world, occupy his heart with it, and do not give him thereof other than what I have allotted for him.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 335, no. 2]
