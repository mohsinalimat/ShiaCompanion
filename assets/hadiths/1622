It is narrated in Bihar al-Anwar that when Imam al-Hasan (AS) used to perform his ablution the colour of his face would change and his joints would tremble. When he was asked about this once, he replied, ‘It is only fitting for one who stands before the Lord of the Throne that his face should change colour and his joints should tremble.’
