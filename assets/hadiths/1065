Imam al-Baqir (AS) said with regards to Allah’s verse in the Qur’an [addressing the Prophet (SAWA)]: “Soon your Lord will give you [that with which] you will be pleased”[ Qur’an 93:5], ‘(This is) intercession, by Allah it is intercession, by Allah it is intercession.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 8, p. 57, no. 72]
