The Prophet (SAWA) said in his will to Abu Dharr, ‘A person will not be totally educated until he sees people like camels, so he should not be amused by their presence and it should not change him, just as the presence of a [real] camel does not change him. Then he must return to his self and become the greatest humiliator of his self.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 72, p. 304, p. 51]
