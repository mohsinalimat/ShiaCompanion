Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said to some people, ‘If you want a good final outcome to your actions and for your soul to be taken while you are in the best of actions then observe the rights of Allah, do not use His bounties to disobey Him, do not allow the fact that Allah is clement with you to delude you [into negligence], and respect and honour everyone whom we praise or those who embrace our love.’
[`Uyoun Akhbar al-Ridha (AS), v. 2, p. 4, no. 8]
