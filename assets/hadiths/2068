The Holy Prophet [p.b.u.h.] said: "Happiness is for the one who will attend the Qaim of my Ahlul Bayt and will follow him before his rise. This person will love his (Qaim's) lovers and hate his enemies, and will accept the leadership of the Imams from before his advent. These ones are my friends, and are the most sincere members of my Ummah whom I honour very much." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 52, p. 129
