Imam al-Kazim (AS), when he visited a person immersed in the pangs of death said, ‘Death is the purifier which purifies the believers from their sins, so it is the last pain that they are struck with as atonement for the last wrongdoing left in them. For the infidels, death strips them of their good deeds, so it is the last pleasure or leisure they will ever experience, and it will be the last reward of a good deed for them …’
