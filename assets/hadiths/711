Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Allah has refused to present falsehood as a certain truth, and He has refused to present the truth to the heart of a believer as a certain falsehood; He has also refused to present falsehood to the heart of a disbeliever as a certain truth. And had he not done thus, the truth would never be distinguished from falsehood.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 5, p. 303, no. 12]
