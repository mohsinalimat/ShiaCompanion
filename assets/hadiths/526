The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘He who sees wrong being done should redress the situation with his own hand, and if he cannot do so then with his tongue, and if he cannot do so then with his heart [disapproving the act], and that is the weakest level of faith.’
[al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib, v. 3, p. 223, no. 1]
