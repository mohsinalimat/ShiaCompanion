Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘I have never seen faith in a certain decree [i.e.decree] more resembling than the doubt of the human being. Every day he bids farewell to graves and goes to funeral processions, but he returns to the delusion of the world, and he does not relinquish desires and sins. If the poor son of Adam did not have a single sin to deviate him and no reckoning to contemplate with than death that scatters his union, disunites his congregation, orphans his children then it would be a must for him to be cautious of what he is in with the greatest of exhaustion and hardship.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 6, p. 137, no. 30]
