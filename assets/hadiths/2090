Imam Sadiq [a.s.] said: "He who is not able to do any good unto us (Ahlul-Bayt) then be may do good to our pious adherents; and he who is not able to visit us, he may visit our righteous followers by which the reward of visiting us (pilgrimage) will be recorded for him." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 74, p. 354
