Imam Mahdi [a.s.] said: I am Al-Mahdi and I am the still-living one who will establish justice throughout the world the same as it has been filled with oppression. Surely the earth will never remain without a witness, and people will not live in lack of a leader. Thus, do not retell this deposite except for your (Muslim) brothers who are Men of God." Kamal-ud-Din, p. 445
