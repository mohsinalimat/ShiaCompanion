Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily the Shi`aa of Ali were those who restrained their stomachs and their sexual desires, who struggled and fought intensely, who worked hard for their Creator, who hoped for His reward and feared His punishment. If you have seen such people, then they are the very Shi`aa of Ja`afar.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 233, no. 9]
