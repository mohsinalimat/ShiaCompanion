Imam al-Baqir (AS), in a letter that he wrote to Sa`ad al-Khayr, said, ‘Allah guards a servant as a result of his Godwariness when his intellect is distant from him, and He illuminates him from blindness and ignorance as a result of his Godwariness. Noah and those with him were saved in the ark and Salih and those with him were saved from the thunderbolt, because of Godwariness. The patient ones are victorious and those groups are saved from destruction through Godwariness.’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 52, no. 16]
