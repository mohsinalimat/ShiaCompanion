Abu Basir narrated, ‘I went to Humayda, to condole her for the death of Abu `Aabdillah (AS) [i.e. Imam al- Sadiq], so she cried and said, ‘O Abu Muhammad, if you saw him as death came upon him, he placed his hand over one eye and said, ‘Call my relatives and my friends to come to me.’ When everyone had gathered around him, he said, ‘Verily our intercession will not avail one who takes his prayer lightly.’
[Mustadrak al-Wasail, v. 3, p. 25, no. 2923]
