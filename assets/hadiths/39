Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘I sought for light of the heart and found it in contemplation and crying. I sought for crossing the Bridge [on the Day of Resurrection] and found it in giving charity. I sought for light of the face and found it in the night prayer.’
[Mustadrak al-Wasail, v. 12, p. 173, no. 13810]
