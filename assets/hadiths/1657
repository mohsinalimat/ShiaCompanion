The Prophet (SAWA) said regarding a group of people who used to delay from praying [in congregation] in the mosque [praying instead in their own houses], ‘A people who neglect to pray in the mosque almost become deserving of having firewood piled at their doors and set alight so that their houses burn down on them.’
[Wasael al-Shi`aah , v. 3, p. 478, no. 2]
