The Prophet (SAWA) narrated, ‘Moses (AS) was once sitting down when Iblis [Satan] approached him … Moses asked him, 'So inform me about the sin which if the son of Adam were to commit would give you mastery over him.’ He replied, 'When he feels proud of himself [for a particular action], and continues to perform that action, deeming his sin insignificant.’
