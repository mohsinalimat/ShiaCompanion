Imam Ali (AS) said, 'He apportions sustenance, abundantly and sparingly, and He distributes them to those in need as well as to those who prosper, and He is Just in His allotment in order that he may test whomever He wishes with prosperity or with hardship, and that He may test therewith the gratefulness and perseverance expressed by both rich and poor.â€™
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 91]
