The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘He who makes the Hereafter his greatest concern when he wakes up and before he sleeps, Allah instills needlessness in his heart and mends his affairs for him; he will not depart from this life before having collected all his sustenance. But the one who makes this life his greatest concern when he wakes up and before he sleeps, Allah instils poverty between his eyes and disbands his affairs; he will not collect from this life more than what was allotted to him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 77, p. 151, no. 104]
