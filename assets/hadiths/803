Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘When the verse: “O you who have faith! Protect yourselves and your kin from the Fire…” was revealed, people asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah! How do we protect ourselves and our kin?’ He replied, ‘Do good deeds and remind your kin about them, and discipline them to obey Allah.’
[Mustadrak al-Wasail, v. 12, p. 201, no. 13882]
