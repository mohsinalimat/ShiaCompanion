Imam Ali (AS) when reprimanding his companions said, ‘How long should I continue to be amicable with you the way one is amicable with camels with a hollow hump, or to worn clothes which when stitched on one side give way on the other… and verily I know what can improve you and how to straighten your crookedness, but I shall not improve your condition by marring myself.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 69]
