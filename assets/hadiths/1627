The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Allah, most High, revealed to me saying, ‘O brother of the prophets and the warners, warn your people not to enter any of My places of worship while having committed a wrong to another servant who holds it against him, for verily I curse him as long as he stands to pray before Me, until he makes amends for that wrong.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 84, p. 257, no. 55]
