Malik-ibn-Anas said about the virtue of Imam Sadiq [a.s.]: "No eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart (soul) has ever been striken that there can (contemporaneously) be anybody higher than (Imam) Ja'far Sadiq [a.s.] from the point of virtue, knowledge, worship, and piety." Bihar-ul-Anwar, vol. 47, p. 28
