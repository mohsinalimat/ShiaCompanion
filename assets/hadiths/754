Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful (AS) would say, ‘The Godwary people have signs that they are known by: speaking truthfully, returning trusts, fulfilling promises ... little association with women, spending for good causes, good-naturedness, ample clemency, and the pursuit of knowledge of whatever brings them closer to Allah Almighty’.
