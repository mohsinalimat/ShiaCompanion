Imam Ali (AS) said in his last will to Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn (AS) after he had been struck by Ibn Muljim, ‘Never abandon the enjoinment of good and the prohibition of wrong lest the evil ones amongst you gain mastery over you whereafter you will supplicate [Allah] but you will not be answered.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 47]
