Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘If there was to be a river outside one’s house into which he bathed five times a day, would there remain any dirt on his body? Similarly the prayer is the river which purifies [one’s soul] - every time one performs a prayer it acts as atonement for one’s sins, except for that sin which takes him and keeps away from his faith.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 82, p. 236, no. 66]
