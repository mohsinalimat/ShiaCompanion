In the tradition recounting the Prophet (SAWA)’s Ascension to the Heavens (al-mi`araj): ‘O Ahmad… be continuous in My remembrance.’ The Prophet (SAWA) asked, ‘O My Lord, how can I be continuous in Your remembrance?’ He replied, ‘Through seclusion from people, despising the sweet and the sour [of the world], and clearing your stomach and your house of the world.’
