Luqman (AS) said to his son, exhorting him, ‘O my son, if you are in doubt about death, then try to avert yourself from falling asleep and you will not be able to, and if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then try to avert yourself from waking up and you will not be able to do that either.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 7, p. 42, no. 13]
