Anas said, ‘I was walking with the Prophet (SAWA), and he was wearing a Najrani robe that had rough sides. A Bedouin came upon him and pulled him by his robe very roughly, so I looked at the side of the Prophet's (SAWA) neck, and the side of the robe had left a mark from the strong pull. He then said, ‘O Muhammad, give me some of Allah's money that you have.’ So the Prophet looked at him, laughed and ordered that he be given some.’
