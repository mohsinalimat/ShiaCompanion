The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘O people! The most virtuous of people is he who is humble from loftiness, abstains from [accumulating] wealth, is fair in spite of his strength and forgiving in spite of his power. Verily, the most virtuous of people is a servant who takes what suffices him from this world, takes self-restraint as his companion therein, prepares his provisions to leave [this world], and is ready for the journey [to the Hereafter].’
