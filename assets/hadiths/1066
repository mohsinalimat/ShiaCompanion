Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said with regards to Allah’s verse in the Qur’an: "No one will have the power to intercede [with Allah], except for him who has taken a covenant with the All-beneficent", ‘[This means] except for him who has been allowed intercession through his acceptance of the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful, Ali (AS) and the Imams after him, as this is the covenant with Allah.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, p. 36, no. 9]
