Abu al-Humaysa’ said, ‘I pledged allegiance to the Prophet (SAWA) before he set out [for a place], and I had an appointment with him in a particular place, but I forgot that day and the next, so I came to him on the third day, so the Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Young man, you have brought great difficulty to me, I have been waiting here for three days.’
