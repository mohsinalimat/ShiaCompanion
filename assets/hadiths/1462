The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Present me with six things and I will present you with Paradise. When you speak, do not lie; when you promise, do not break it; when you are entrusted with something, do not betray; lower your gazes, guard your private parts, restrain your hands and your tongues.’
[Amali al-Saduq, p. 82, no. 2]
