Imam al-Sadiq (AS) was once asked by Sa`aid b. Yasar whether he should supplicate in the state of prostration or in the state of bowing, to which he replied, 'Supplicate while prostrating for verily the nearest the servant can ever be to Allah is in the state of prostration, so supplicate Allah for your worldly needs as well as for your life in the Hereafter.â€™
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 85, p. 131, no. 6]
