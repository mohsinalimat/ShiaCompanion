Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘Whoever dies accepting our guardianship during the occultation of the one who will rise up [the awaited twelfth Imam, al-Mahdi], Allah will grant him the reward of a thousand such martyrs as died in the battles of Badr and Uhud.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 82, p. 173, no. 6]
