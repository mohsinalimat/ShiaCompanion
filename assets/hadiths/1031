Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Verily Allah, Blessed and most High, existed when nothing else did, He is light not darkness, truthful with no falsehood about Him, all-knowing with no ignorance about Him, ever-living with no death about Him, and He is such today, and thus will He remain forever.’
[al-Tawhid, p. 141, no. 5]
