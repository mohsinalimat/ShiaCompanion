Imam Ali (AS) was once asked which was better, justice or generosity, to which he replied, ‘Justice puts things in their rightful place, whereas generosity takes them away from their course. Justice is a general predominant state, whereas generosity is a transient characteristic. Justice is therefore the nobler and better of the two.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 437]
