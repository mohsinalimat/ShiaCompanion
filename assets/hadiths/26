Imam Hasan (AS) said, ‘It is not appropriate for he who knows the magnitude of Allah to be haughty, for the glory of those who know the magnitude of Allah is that they become humble, and the honour of those who know the Majesty of Allah is that they humiliate themselves to Him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 104, no. 3]
