Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The people of the Fire will be kept permanently in the Fire because their intentions in the world were such that if they were to live forever therein, they would disobey Allah forever. And verily the people of Paradise will also be made to remain in Paradise permanently because their intentions in this world were to obey Allah if only they were to live there forever. So, it is due to their intentions that these and those have their permanent residence.’ Then Imam recited the word of Allah, the Exalted: “Say, ‘Everyone acts according to his character” 170 and said that it means according to his intention.’
