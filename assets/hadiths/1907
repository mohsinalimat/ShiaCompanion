Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘There is a group of people who claim that I am their Imam, but by Allah, I am no Imam of theirs - may Allah curse them - every time I conceal a secret, they disclose it. Every time I explain a matter, they retort, saying, ‘Actually that means such and such.’ I am only the Imam of those who obey me.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 2, p. 80, no. 76]
