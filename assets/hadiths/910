Imam Ali (AS), in his intimate supplication said, ‘O Allah, grant me the perfection of devotion to You, and illuminate the sight of our hearts with the radiance of being able to behold You until the sight of our hearts pierces through the veils of light, reaching the source of Exaltedness, and our souls become attached to the glory of Your Sacredness.’
[Iqbal al-A`amal, v. 3, p. 299]
