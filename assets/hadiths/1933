Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Allah, most High, revealed to Prophet Moses (AS) saying, ‘O Moses, thank Me with the thanks that is due to Me.’ Moses asked, ‘O Lord, but how can I thank You with the thanks that is due to You, when every single expression of thanks that I may convey has been bestowed upon Me by You?’ He replied, ‘O Moses, you thank Me with the thanks that is due to Me when you acknowledge that it is indeed from Me.’
