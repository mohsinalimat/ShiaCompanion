al-Qazzaz narrated, ‘Al-Ridha (AS) went out to await the arrival of some people who were coming to visit him when the time for prayer set in. He went towards a nearby fort and took shade under a rock, saying, ‘Announce the call for prayer.’ I replied, ‘Why don’t we wait for our companions to catch up with us?’ He replied, ‘May Allah forgive you. Do not ever delay the prayer from the earliest moment of its onset to the latest without a good excuse. You must always pray at the earliest time’, so I announced the call for prayer and we prayed.’
