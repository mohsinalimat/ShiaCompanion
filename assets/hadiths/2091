Imam Baqir [a.s.] said: "The best means by which servants can obtain nearness to Allah, Mighty and Glorious, is the obedience to Allah, the obedience to His Messenger, and the obedience to those charged with (spiritual) authority." Then, he [a.s.] added: "The love of us (Ahlul Bayt) is Faith and the hatred of us is infidelity." Al-Kafi, vol. 1, p. 187
