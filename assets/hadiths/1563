Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘I hate it for you to think that I like commendation and listening to praises when, praise be to Allah, I am not so. If I did like for such things to be said, I would abandon it as degradation of Allah Almighty in accepting something that He is more worthy of in Grandeur and Glory. People might be pleased with praises after hardships, but do not praise me good praises for what I have done for Allah Almighty, and for you in what is left of the rights I have not yet fulfilled, and obligations I must duly accomplish. So do no speak to me the way you speak to tyrants, and do not evade me as the people of passion are [to be] evaded, and do not meet me with flattery.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 216]
