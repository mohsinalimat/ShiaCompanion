Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘When you make a promise to children then fulfil that promise to them, because they perceive you as the one who provides them with the means of subsistence, and Allah is not angered by anything the way He is angered by [matters pertaining to] the rights of women and children.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 104, p. 73, no. 23]
