Imam Ali (AS) said to a man who wished his brother was present so that he could see the victory of Allah over His enemies at the Battle of the Camel, ‘Did your brother desire to be with us?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He (AS) said, ‘Then he has witnessed us, and groups of people have witnessed us in our army while they are still in the loins of men and the wombs of women. Time will bring them out and faith will become strong through them.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 12]
