Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Whoever gives a speaker his full attention has indeed expressed a form of worship or adulation to him. If the speaker leads one to Allah through his words, then it is as if one worships Allah [by giving him attention], but if he leads one to Satan through his words, it is as if one worships Satan.’
[al-Kafi, v. 6, p. 434, no. 24]
