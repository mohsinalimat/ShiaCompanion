The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Allah Almighty said, ‘By My Might and Exaltedness…no sooner does a servant prefer My desire over his own desire than I protect him with My angels, and charge the heavens and the earth with his sustenance. I will be behind every transaction he makes with every trader, and the world will only come to him forcefully.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 335, no. 2]
