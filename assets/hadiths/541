Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘If you want Allah to protect you from an evil final outcome [to your life], then know that whatever good that comes is from Allah’s grace and divine succour, and whatever bad that comes, know that Allah has delayed it for you and you have already been given respite for it, so be aware of Allah’s clemency and pardon for you.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 70, p. 392, no. 60]
