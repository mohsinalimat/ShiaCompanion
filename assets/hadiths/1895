Imam al-Sadiq (AS) narrated, ‘An old woman from among the Israelites asked Moses (AS) a question; she said, ‘I will not do what you wish until you give me a few things: you cause my leg to work, give me back my sight, return to me my youth and make me be with you in Paradise.’
[al-Faqih, v. 1, p. 193, no. 594]
