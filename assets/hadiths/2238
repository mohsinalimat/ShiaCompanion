Fatima, salutations of Allah be upon her, has nine names before Allah: Fatima, al-Siddiqa (the veracious one), al-Mubarika (the blessed), al-Tahira (the clean), al-Zakiyya (the pure), al-Radiyya (the content), al-Mardiyya (the one who pleases Allah), al-Muhadditha (the one who speaks to angels) and al-Zahra’ (the radiant one).
