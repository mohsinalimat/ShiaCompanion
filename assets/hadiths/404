Imam al-Rida (AS), when visiting one of his sick companions, asked, ‘How are you?’ He replied, ‘I have met death after you!’ referring to the pain he had endured from his intense sickness’, so he said, ‘How did you find it?’ He said, ‘Very painful.’ He (AS) said, ‘You have not met it, you have only met what is warning you of it and it is introducing you to some of its states…’
