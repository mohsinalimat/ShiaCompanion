Jabir b. `Aabdullah al-Ansari said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) visited us, and he saw an untidy man whose hair was dishevelled, so he said, ‘Did this man not find anything with which to tame his hair?!’ He then saw another man, who was wearing dirty clothes, so he said, ‘Did this man not have any water to wash his clothes with?!’
