Imam al-Kazim (AS) once said while standing at a graveside, ‘Indeed something that ends with this [i.e. death] is worthy of its beginning being spent in abstemiousness. And indeed something that begins with this is worthy of its end being feared with apprehension.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 320, no. 9]
