It is narrated in Misbah al-Shari`aa (The Lantern of the Path): ‘The lowest level of thankfulness is to see the bounty as coming from Allah irrespective of its cause, and without attaching the heart to any other cause save Allah, Mighty and Exalted. It consists of being satisfied with what is given, and not disobeying Him by means of His bounty, nor opposing Him in any of His commands and prohibitions as a result of that bounty.’
[Misbah al-Shari`aa, p. 53]
