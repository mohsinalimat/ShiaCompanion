`Aa’isha, when asked about the character of the Prophet (SAWA) in his house, said, ‘He was the best of people in character; he neither swore nor was obscene; he did not make a clamour in the markets, and did not return bad with its like, but he would pardon and forgive.’
[al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, v. 1, p. 365]
