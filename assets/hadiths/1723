Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in one of his exhortations, ‘Know O son of Adam that beyond this [life] is something greater, more horrendous and more painful for the hearts - the Day of Resurrection. That is the day when people will be gathered and that will be an eventful day wherein Allah will gather people from the first to the last.’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 73, no. 29]
