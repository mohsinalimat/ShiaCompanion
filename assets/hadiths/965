The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘The light of inner knowledge is brought about by hunger whereas distance from Allah is caused by satiety. Proximity to Allah is brought about by loving the poor and drawing near to them, so do not eat to your fill lest the light of inner knowledge be extinguished from your hearts.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 70, p. 71, no. 20]
