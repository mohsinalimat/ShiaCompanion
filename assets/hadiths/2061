Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘Verily a seed grows in soft ground and does not grow on stone, in the same way that wisdom thrives in the heart of the humble and does not thrive in the heart of the proud and haughty , because Allah has made humbleness the instrument of the intellect.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 312, no. 1]
