Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily Allah says, ‘By My Might and Exaltedness, I do not answer the supplication of one who has been wronged when he calls Me regarding the wrong that has been done unto him, while someone else holds a similar claim of wrong against him.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, 75, p. 312, no. 20]
