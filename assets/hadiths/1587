Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘There are three things that are the pride of a believer and his ornament in this world and the Hereafter: prayer at the end of the night [night vigil], his despair of [possessing] that which others own, and his allegiance to the Imam from the progeny of Muhammad (SAWA).’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 234, no. 311]
