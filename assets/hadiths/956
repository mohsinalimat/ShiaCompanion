Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said in his supplication, 'O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Household, and spare me the concerns which distract me, employ me in that which You will ask me about tomorrow, and let me pass my days [engaged] in that for which You have created me!'[al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, supplication 20]
