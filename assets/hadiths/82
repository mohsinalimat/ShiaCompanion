Imam Ali (AS) said, 'He who renounces this worldly life, neither concerning himself with its baseness nor vying for its glory, Allah rewards him with a gift that is unobtainable through any of His creatures, grants him knowledge without the need for learning, secures wisdom in his heart and makes it flow upon his tongue.â€™
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 78, p. 63, no. 155]
