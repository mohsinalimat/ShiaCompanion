Al-Fazl b. Abi Qurra narrated, ‘We walked into the presence of Abu `Aabdillah [al-Sadiq] (AS) and he was working at fixing his wall, so we said, ‘May Allah sacrifice us for you, let us work for you, or let the servants do it.’ He said, ‘No, let me be, for I desire for Allah to see me working with my hands and earning a lawful livelihood through tiring my own self.’
