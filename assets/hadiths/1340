Anas said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) was the best of people, the most generous of people, and the most courageous of people. The people of Madina became scared one night, and they ran towards the place that the noise was coming from, and the Prophet (SAWA) met them on his way back from there - as he had preceded them to the noise, mounted on a barebacked horse belonging to Abu Talha, and he had his sword hanging from his neck, saying, ‘Why are you scared? Why are you scared?’.
