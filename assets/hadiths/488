Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘Allah Almighty has said, ‘By My Might and Exaltedness, My Greatness and Loftiness, and by My High Status, no sooner does a servant prefer My desire over his own desire than I will suffice him in his losses, I will guarantee his sustenance upon the Heavens and the earth, and I will be behind his every transaction with every trader.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 137, no. 1]
