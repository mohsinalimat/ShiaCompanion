Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘My father (AS) refined my manners by three [statements]. He said to me: ‘O son! A man who befriends a vile person cannot escape blame, and a man who does not restrain his words will live in regret, and a man who enters suspicious places will become subject to accusations.’
