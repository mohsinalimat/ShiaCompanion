The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Whoever testifies with a true testimony wanting to uphold the rights of a Muslim person, he will come on the Day of Resurrection and his face will reflect a light as far as the eye can see, and all of creation will know him by name and lineage.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 104, p. 311, no. 9]
