Imam al-Sadiq (AS), with regards to Allah's verse in the Qur'an: "Charities are only for the poor...", said, 'The poor man is he who does not beg from people [despite his poverty], the destitute lives in even harsher conditions than him, and the wretched one lives in the most straitened circumstances of all.â€™
