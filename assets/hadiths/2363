To Masma’, one of those who mourned over Imam Husayn (a) – May Allah have mercy upon your tears! Do know that you are regarded as being of those who are deeply concerned about us and of those who are happy at our happiness and aggrieved at our sorrow. Do know that you shall witness the presence of my fathers near you at the time of your death.
— Imam Sadiq (a), Wasa’il al-Shia
