Imam Ali (AS) once took Kumayl out to the desert, and when they reached the desert, he let out a deep sigh and said, ‘O Kumayl, knowledge is better than wealth for wealth is reduced by spending whereas knowledge causes your spendings to flourish, and any good product of wealth ceases when it ceases to exist.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 147]
