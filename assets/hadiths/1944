Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘The right of he who does a kindly act towards you is that you thank him and mention his kindness; that you reward him with beautiful words and supplicate for him sincerely in that which is between you and Allah. If you do that, you have thanked him both secretly and openly. Then if you are able to repay him one day, repay him.’
