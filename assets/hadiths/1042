The Prophet (SAWA), when he sent Ali on a military expedition with a brigade, and a man said to his brother, ‘Lets go on the military expedition with the brigade of Ali, we might get a slave or an animal or something of value- said, ‘Actions are according to intentions, and every person has what they intend. So whoever goes on a conquest in search of what is with Allah then their reward will be from Allah, and whoever goes on a conquest in search of worldly affairs or intends restraints will not get other than what he intended.’
[Amali al-Tusi, p. 618, no. 1274]
