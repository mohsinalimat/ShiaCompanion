With the advent of the month of Muharram, my father Imam Kadhim (a) would never be seen laughing; gloom and sadness would overcome him for (the first) ten days of the month; and when the tenth day of the month would dawn, it would be a day of tragedy, grief and weeping for him.
— Imam Ridha (a), Amali al-Saduq
