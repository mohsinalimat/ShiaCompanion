Imam Ali (AS) said, condemning those who follow Satan, 'They have taken Satan as the controller of their affairs, and he has in turn adopted them as his partners. He has laid eggs and hatched them in their bosoms, and creeps and crawls onto their laps, until he sees through their eyes and speaks with their tongues. Thus does he lead them to commit errors and glamorizes their own foolish deeds to them, like the act of one whom Satan has made partner in his domain, speaking lies through his tongue.â€™
