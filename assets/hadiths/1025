Imam Ali (AS) said in reply to Dha`alab’s question about his being able to see his Lord, ‘Woe to you O Dha`alab! I do not worship a Lord Whom I cannot see!’ So Dha`alab asked, ‘But how do you see Him? Describe Him to us.’ Imam (AS) replied, ‘Woe betide you! Eyes do not see Him by looking with the sights; it is the hearts that behold Him with the realities of faith.’
