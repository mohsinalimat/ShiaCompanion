Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘If anyone has a need from Allah, then he should begin by sending blessings upon Muhammad and his family, then ask his need. Thereafter he should seal it by sending blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, for verily Allah is too kind than to just accept the two blessings [at the beginning and at the end] and leave the middle, because the request for blessings on Muhammad and his family is never veiled from Him.’
