Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘But Allah tries His servants with various tribulations, renders them to worship Him through struggles, tests them with various types of distresses, all in order to extract pride out from their hearts, and to settle humbleness in their souls, and in order to make all these open doors to His grace an easy means to His pardon.’ [Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 192]
