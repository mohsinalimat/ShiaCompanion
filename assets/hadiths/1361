The Prophet (SAWA) said, 'O AbU Dharr, verily for as long as you remain seated in the mosque Allah, most High, will grant you an extra level in Paradise for every breath you take, the angels send salutations on you, and ten good deeds are recorded and ten evil deeds wiped away for every breath you take therein.â€™
