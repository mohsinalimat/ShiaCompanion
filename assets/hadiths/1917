The Prophet (SAWA) was asked by Ibn `Aabbas about the verse of Allah in the Qur’an, “And the Foremost Ones are the foremost ones: they are the ones brought near to Allah” [Qur’an 56:10,11], to which he replied, ‘This refers to Ali and his Shi`aa - they will be the foremost to enter Paradise, the ones brought near to Allah through His Magnanimity over them.’
