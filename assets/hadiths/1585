Imam al-Rida (AS) said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful [ Imam Ali (AS)] visited Sa`asa`aa b. Suhan when he was sick, so when he wanted to leave he stood up and said, ‘O Sa`asa`aa, do not display pride in front of your brothers that I visited you, and fear Allah.’
[Mustadrak al-Wasa`il, v. 12, p. 90, no. 13599]
