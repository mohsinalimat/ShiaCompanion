The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘There are eight categories of people whose prayer is not accepted: the slave who has escaped from his master, until he returns to him; the defiant wife whose husband is displeased with her; the one who withholds payment of the alms-tax; the one who neglects to perform the ablution; the discerning woman who prays without covering her head; the leader of a community who leads them in prayer while they detest him; the intoxicated one; and the one who resists the urge to urinate or defecate [before commencing the prayer].’
[Makarim al-Akhlaq, v. 2, p. 324, no. 2656]
