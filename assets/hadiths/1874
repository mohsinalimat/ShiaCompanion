Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘If any of you wants his supplication to be answered then he should make a lawful earning and stop wronging people, for verily the supplication of a servant who has unlawful food in his stomach or has wronged anyone from Allah’s creation will not be raised to Allah.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 93, p. 321, no. 31]
