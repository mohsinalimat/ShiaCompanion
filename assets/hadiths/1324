Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) was like a roaming physician who has set ready his ointments and heated his instruments. He used them wherever the need arose for curing blind hearts, deaf ears, and dumb tongues. He followed with his medicines the spots of negligence and the places of perplexity. They [the people] did not take the light from the lights of his wisdom nor did they produce flame from the flint of his sparkling knowledge. So in this matter, they are like grazing cattle and hard stones.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 108]
