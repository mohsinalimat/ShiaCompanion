The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘He who treats people in such a way that he never wrongs them, and speaks to them and never lies to them, and when he makes a promise to them he never breaks it, such a person is perfect in his valorous qualities, his justice is manifest, and it becomes obligatory to consider him as one’s brother and prohibited to backbite him.’
