Imam al-Baqir (AS) said, ‘The intention of a believer is better than his action, that is because he intends good that he cannot perform, and the intention of the disbeliever is worse than his action because he intends evil and he wishes in evil what he cannot perform.’
[`AeIlal al-Shara’i`a, p. 524, no. 1]
