`Aabdullah b. ‘Amir narrated, ‘My mother called me one day when the Prophet (SAWA) was sitting in our house, and she said, ‘Come here so I can give you something.’ The Prophet (SAWA) asked her, ‘What did you want to give him?’ She said, ‘I wanted to give him a date.’ So the Prophet (SAWA) said to her, ‘If you were not to have given him anything, it would have been written against you as a lie.’
