The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Nobody who dies and who has a good position with Allah that pleases him ever wishes to return back to this world, not even to be given the world and all that is in it, except the martyr, for he wishes to return to it in order that he may be martyred again because of the virtue that he has seen in martyrdom.’
