Imam al-Kazim (AS), when he was asked about the lowest degree of inner knowledge, replied, ‘It is to affirm that there is no god but He, and that He has no likeness or match, and that He is eternal, positively proven to exist, present and not absent, and that there is nothing like Him.’
[al-Kafi, v. 1, p. 86, no. 1]
