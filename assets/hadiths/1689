Imam Ali (AS) said in the intimate supplication of the month of Sha’ban [al-Munajat al-Sha`abaniyya: the intimate supplication of the month of Sha`aban recited by Imam `Ali (AS) and the Im?ms from his progeny (AS) during the sacred month of Sha`aban.], ‘My God! Inspire me with fervour for Your remembrance until I have become inspired with Your remembrance, and a spiritual zeal for the refreshing salvation of Your Names and the place of Your sanctity.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 94, p. 98, no. 13]
