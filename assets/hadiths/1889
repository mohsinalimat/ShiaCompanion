It is narrated in Bihar al-Anwar that among Allah’s exhortations to Prophet Jesus (AS) was, ‘O Jesus, call upon Me with a supplication of a sorrowful one, as if he is drowning and has no saviour…and only supplicate Me by imploring Me, with the supplication being your prime concern, for verily if you call Me like that, I will answer you.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 93, p. 314, no. 19]
