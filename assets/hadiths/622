Imam al-Ridha (AS) said, ‘The believer is not a believer until he possesses three qualities: a practice [characteristic] of his Lord, a practice of his Prophet (SAWA), and a practice of his guardian (AS). As for the practice of his Lord, it is to conceal secrets; the practice of his Prophet (SAWA) is amicableness towards people; and the practice of his guardian (AS) is patience in both times of ease and difficulty.’
