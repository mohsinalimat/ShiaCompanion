Imam al-Sadiq (AS), when asked about Allah’s verse in the Qur’an: "So do not flaunt your piety" said, ‘It refers to when someone says, ‘I prayed yesterday and fasted yesterday’, and its like. The Prophet (SAWA) then said, ‘A group of people would wake up and say, 'We prayed and fasted yesterday', and Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘But I sleep night and day and if I found any time between that I would sleep too [i.e. making light of his worship in front of people].’
