The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘Whoever sleeps and wakes up possessing three things, then bounties for him in this world are complete: he who sleeps and wakes up with a healthy body, safe in his den, with enough sustenance for the day. And if he has a fourth thing then the bounties of this world and the Hereafter are complete in him, and that is faith.’
[Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, p. 36]
