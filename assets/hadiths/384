Imam Ali (AS), in a letter he wrote to al-Ashtar when he appointed him governor of Egypt, said, ‘Among all things made incumbent by Allah, there is nothing on which people are more strongly united, in spite of the difference of their opinions and the diversity of their views, than the respect for fulfilling promises.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Letter 53]
