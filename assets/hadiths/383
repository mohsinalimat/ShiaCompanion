Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Verily promises are chains on people’ s necks until the Day of Resurrection. So whoever fulfils them is delivered by Allah, and whoever breaks them is forsaken by Allah, and whoever takes them lightly will have to contend with the One Who has placed special emphasis on them and Who has enjoined upon His creation to fulfil them.’
