Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Whoever thinks that he is superior to someone else is of the arrogant.’ Abu Hafs b. Ghiyath said, ‘I asked him: [What if] one sees that they are superior in their being good when they see others committing sins?’ The Imam said, ‘Far from it, far from it! For maybe he has been forgiven for what he has done and whilst you will be stopped and held accountable. Have you not read the story of the magicians of Moses (AS) in the Qur’an?’
