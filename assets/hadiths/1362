Imam Ali (AS) said, 'The prayer of one who lives neighbouring the mosque [yet prays at home] is null and void unless he prays inside the mosque, except if he has an excuse or if he is sick.’ When asked who was considered as neighbouring the mosque, he replied, 'Anyone who hears the call to prayer.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 83, p. 379, no. 47]
