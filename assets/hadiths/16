Imam al-Sadiq (AS) narrated, ‘The Prophet (SAWA) said, ‘The worst of arrogance is despising people and depreciating the truth.’ At this, `Aabd al-A`ala b. A`ayan asked, ‘And what is despising people and depreciating the truth?’ He said, ‘It is when one is ignorant of the truth and slanders its people, and whoever does this has wrested Allah of His robe.’
