Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘Patience comes in the form of either persevering in the face of an affliction, or enduring an act of obedience, or restraining oneself against an act of disobedience. And this third type is of a higher calibre than the first two.’
[Sharhe Nahj al-Balagha li Ibn Abi al-Hadid, v. 1, p. 319]
