If any of you wants his supplication to be answered then he should make a lawful earning and repay people their rights, for verily the supplication of a servant who has unlawful food in his stomach or has wronged anyone from Allah’s creation will not be raised to Allah.
— Imam Sadiq (a), Bihar al-Anwar
