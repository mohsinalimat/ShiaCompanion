Imam al-Kazim (AS) said, ‘I urge you to supplicate, for verily supplication to Allah and seeking from Allah repels calamity which may have been destined and decreed with just the execution remaining, so if Allah is supplicated and is asked to avert a calamity, it is averted.’
[al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 470, no. 8]
