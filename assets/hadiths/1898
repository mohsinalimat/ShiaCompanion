Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘I complained to the Prophet (SAWA) about people’s jealousy towards me, so he replied, ‘O Ali, the first four people to enter Paradise will be myself, you, Hasan and Husayn. The rest of our progeny will be behind us, those who love us will be behind them, and our Shi`aa will be on either side of us.’
[al-Irshad, v. 1, p. 43]
