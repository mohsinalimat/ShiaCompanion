Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Verily our Shi`aa are those who possess four eyes: two in their head, as well as two in their heart. Actually, all people are such, except that Allah has opened their [the Shi`aa’s] eyes, and blinded others’ [as a result of their rejection of His guidance].’
[al-Kafi, v. 8, p. 215, no. 260]
