Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) said, ‘The right of your companion is that you share his company with bounty and fairness. You should honour him as he honours you, and should not let him be the first to extend his generosity. And if he is the first to do so, then repay him. Wish for him as he wishes for you, and restrain him from any act of disobedience that he might contemplate. Be a mercy for him, and not a chastisement.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 74, p. 7, no. 1]
