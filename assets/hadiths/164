Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘O people, let Allah see you fearing Him at the time of happiness just as you fear Him in time of distress. Certainly he who is given ease [of life] and does not consider it as a means of gradual baiting towards tribulation [wrongdoing], considers himself safe against what is to be feared, while he who is afflicted with straitened circumstances but does not perceive them to be a trial loses the coveted reward.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 358]
