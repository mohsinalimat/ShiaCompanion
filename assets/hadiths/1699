Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘Allah Almighty said, ‘O son of Adam, remember Me within yourself and I will remember you within Myself. O son of Adam, remember Me in secret and I will remember you when [you are] in secret. O son of Adam, remember Me when in an assembly and I will remember you in an assembly which is better than your assembly.’
[Bihar al-Anwar, v. 93, p. 158, no. 31]
