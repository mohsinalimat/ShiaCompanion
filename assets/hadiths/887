Imam Ali (AS) said, ‘If I was to strike the tip of the nose of a believer with my sword to hate me with as much hatred as he can, and if I was to pour down the whole world onto a hypocrite to love me with as much love as possible, [they would not be able to], and this is because of what has been destined, as this was passed on through the tongue of the unchooled Prophet (SAWA), saying, ‘ Ali, a believer can never hate you and a hypocrite can never love you.’
[Nahj al-Balagha, Saying 45]
