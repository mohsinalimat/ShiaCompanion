Imam al-Sadiq (AS) said, ‘The glorification of Fatima al-Zahra’ [The glorification of Fatima al-Zahra’ (AS), otherwise known as Tasbih al-Zahra’ is composed of reciting Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greater) 34 times, Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah) 33 times and Subhanallah (Glory be to Allah) 33 times. Usually it is recommended to recite it after every obligatory prayer (ed.)] (AS) is from the frequent remembrance which Allah mentions, “Remember Allah with a frequent remembrance.”[ al-Kafi, v. 2, p. 500, no. 4]
