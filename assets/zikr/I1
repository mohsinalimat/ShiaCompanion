    "data": "The time between dawn and sunrise is one of the blessed hours. Many traditions that are reported from the Ahlul Bait (a.s.) have revealed the merits of this hour and encouraged on mentioning Almighty Allah, glorifying Him, and worshipping Him at this very time, which has been called by some narrations as the time of inadvertence.\nIn this respect, Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported to have said, “Iblees (Satan), may Allah’s curses be poured on him, distributes his troops at sunset and sunrise. Therefore, mention Allah, the Almighty and Majestic, at these two times more than any other time. Seek Allah’s protection against the evils of Iblees and his troops, and seek Him to protect your children against Satan at these two times in particular, because these two times are times of inadvertence.”\nIt is worth mentioning that to sleep at this time is discommended. In this regard, Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) is also reported to have said, “Sleeping at the pre-sunrise hour is ill-omened; it dismisses sustenance and makes the face seem pale and lose its color. It is the sleep of all ill-omened ones. Verily, Allah the All-exalted distributes sustenance in the time between dawn and sunrise; therefore, beware of sleeping (at this time).”\nShaykh al-±usi, in Mi¥bah al-Mutahajjid, has mention the following supplicatory prayer to be said at the crack of dawn:\nاَللّٰهُمَّ اَنْتَ صَاحِبُنَا\nALLAAHUMMA ANTA SAAHEBONAA\nO Allah, You are verily our Patron;\nفَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهٖ\nFASALLE A’LAA MOHAMMADIN WA AALEHI\nso, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Household\nوَاَفْضِلْ عَلَيْنَا\nWA AFZALE A’LAYNAA\nand bestow upon us with Your favors.\nاَللّٰهُمَّ بِنِعْمَتِكَ تَتِمُّ الصَّالِحَاتُ\nALLAAHUMMA BE-NE’MATEKA TATIMMUS SAALEHAATO\nO Allah, through Your graces only are the righteous things perfected;\nفَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهٖ\nFASALLE A’LAA MOHAMMADIN WA AALEHI\nso, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Household\nوَاَتْمِمْهَا عَلَيْنَا\nWA ATMIMHAA A’LAYNAA\nand make them perfect for us.\nعَائِذًا بِاللهِ مِنَ النَّارِ\nA’AEZAN BILLAAHE MENAN NAARE\nI seek Allah’s protection against Hellfire.\nعَائِذًا بِاللهِ مِنَ النَّارِ \nA’AEZAN BILLAAHE MENAN NAARE\nI seek Allah’s protection against Hellfire.\nعَائِذًا بِاللهِ مِنَ النَّارِ\nA’AEZAN BILLAAHE MENAN NAARE\nI seek Allah’s protection against Hellfire.\nThe following supplicatory prayer may be said thereafter:\nيَا فَالِقَهٗ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا اَرٰى\nYAA FAALEQAHU MIN HAYSO LAA ARAA\nO He Who cleaves it from where I cannot see\nوَمُخْرِجَهٗ مِنْ حَيْثُ اَرٰى\nWA MUKHREJAHU MIN HAYSO ARAA\nand causes it to come out from where I can see;\nصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِهٖ\nSALLE A’LAA MOHAMMADIN WA AALEHI\n(please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Household,\nوَاجْعَلْ اَوَّلَ يَوْمِنَا هٰذَا صَلَاحًا\nWAJ A’L AWWALA YAWMENAA HAAZAA SALAAHAN\nand make the beginning of this day of mine righteousness,\nوَاَوْسَطَهٗ فَلَاحًا\nWA AWSATAHU FALAAHAN\nits middle prosperity,\nوَآخِرَهٗ نَجَاحًا\nWA AAKHERAHU NAJAAHAN\nand its end success.\nThe following supplicatory prayer may be repeated ten times after that:\nاَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْ اُشْهِدُكَ\nALLAAHUMMA INNEE USH-HEDOKA\nO Allah, I call You to witness for me\nاَنَّهٗ مَا اَصْبَحَ بِيْ مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ\nANNAHU MAA ASBAHA BEE MIN NE’MATIN\nthat whatever bliss I may enjoy in this morning\nاَوْ عَافِيَةٍ فِيْ دِيْنٍ اَوْ دُنْيَا\nAW A’AFEYATIN FEE DEENIN AW DUNYAA\nand whatever wellbeing in a religious or worldly affair,\nفَمِنْكَ وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَكَ\nFAMINKA WAHDAKA LAA SHAREEKA LAKA\nthen all of them are from You alone, without having any partner with You.\nلَكَ الْحَمْدُ\nLAKAL HAMDO\nAll praise be to You\nوَ لَكَ الشُّكْرُ بِهَا عَلَيَّ\nWA LAKASH SHUKRO BEHAA A’LAYYA\nand all thanks be to You for that bliss given to me\nحَتّٰى تَرْضٰى وَ بَعْدَ الرِّضَا\nHATTAA TARZAA WA BA’DAR REZAA\nuntil You please and beyond Your pleasure.\nExcept for these supplicatory prayers, numerous supplicatory prayers have been reported to be said at this hour. However, the most favorable of these are the following statements that have been expressed in a tradition as al-baqiyat al-¥alihat (The ever-abiding, good deeds):\nسُبْحَانَ اللهِ\nSUBHAANAL LAAHE\nAll glory be to Allah,\nوَ الْحَمْدُ لِلهِ\nWAL HAMDO LILLAAHE\nall praise be to Allah,\nوَ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ\nWA LAA ELAAHA ILLAL LAAHO\nthere is no god save Allah,\nوَ اللهُ اَكْبَرُ\nWAL LAAHO AKBARO\nand Allah is the Greatest.\nIt is also recommended to say the following:\nلَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ\nLAA ELAAHA ILLAL LAAHO\nThere is no god save Allah,\nوَحْدَهٗ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهٗ\nWAHDAHU LAA SHAREEKA LAHU\nalone without having any partner.\nلَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ\nLAHUL MULKO WA LAHUL HAMDO\nTo him is the kingdom and to Him is all praise.\nيُحْيِيْ وَ يُمِيْتُ وَ يُمِيْتُ وَ يُحْيِيْ\nYOHYEE WA YOMEETO WA YOMEETO WA YOHYEE\nHe gives life and causes to die and causes to die and gives life\nوَ هُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوْتُ\nWA HOWA HAYYUN LAA YAMOOTO\nwhile He is Ever-living and He never dies.\nبِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ\nBEYADEHIL KHAYRO\nIn His hand is the good\nوَ هُوَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيْرٌ\nWA HOWA A’LAA KULLE SHAY-IN QADEER.\nand He has power over all things.\nOnce you hear the call to the Dawn Prayer (i.e. azan), you may say the following:\nاَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْ اَسْاَلُكَ بِاِقْبَالِ نَهَارِكَ\nALLAAHUMMA INNEE AS-ALOKA BE-IQBAALE NAHAAREKA\nO Allah, I beseech You in the name of the advent of Your daylight,\nوَ اِدْبَارِ لَيْلِكَ\nWA IDBAARE LAYLEKA\nthe departure of Your night,\nوَ حُضُورِ صَلَوَاتِكَ\nWA HOZOORE SALAWAATEKA\nthe approaching of the time of praying to You,\nوَ اَصْوَاتِ دُعَائِكَ\nWA SAWAATE DO-A’AEKA\nthe sounds that supplicate You,\nوَ تَسْبِيْحِ مَلَائِكَتِكَ\nWA TASBEEHE MALAA-EKATEKA\nand the glorifications of Your angels,\nاَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ\nAN TOSALLEYA A’LAA MOHAMMADIN WA AALE MOHAMMADIN\nto (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad\nوَ اَنْ تَتُوْبَ عَلَيَّ\nWA AN TATOOBA A’LAYYA\nand to accept my repentance.\nاِنَّكَ اَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيْمُ\nINNAKA ANTAT TAWWAABUR RAHEEM.\nVerily, You are the Oft-Returning, the Most Merciful.",
